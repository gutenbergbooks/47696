<p class='c013'>The bus from San Antonio pulled in to the curb
and stopped. The door snapped open. Half a dozen
uniformed upperclassmen wearing grim expressions
moved closer to the vehicle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Roll out of it, you Misters!” bawled their leader
in a voice of authority. “Shake the lead out of your
shoes! Pop to it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake and Chick Enders were among the
first out of the bus, but they were not quick enough
to suit the reception committee.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you all crippled?” rasped the spokesman of
the upperclass “processors.” “Come alive and fall in—<i>here</i>,
on this line. Dress <i>right</i>! I said <i>dress</i>—don’t
stick your necks out. Atten-<i>shun</i>! Hope you haven’t
forgotten <i>all</i> the military drill you learned at primary.
You, Mister! Rack it back. Eyes on a point.
And out with your chest if you have any. Keep those
thumbs at your trouser seams.... All right! Here’s
your baggage tag. Write your name on it. Tag your
baggage—and make it snappy. Stand at attention
when you’ve finished. <i>Hurry!</i> That’s it.... Take
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>baggage in left hand—left, not right. And wipe off
your smile, Mister! ’Sbetter.... Mister Danvers,
you will now take charge of these dum-dums.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry was sweating. The blazing Texas sun was
in his eyes. His chest ached for a normal, relaxed
breath; yet he dared not move. Mister Danvers’
barking command came as a sharp relief.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Right face.... Forward, <i>march</i>! Hup! Hup!
Hup! Pull those chins back. Hup! Hup! Eyes on
a point! And hold your right hands still—this isn’t a
goose-step. Hup! Hup! Shoulders back—grab a brace—you’re
in the Army now! Hup! Hup! Dee-tachment,
<i>halt</i>!”</p>

<p class='c014'>For more strained moments the new arrivals stood
on the arched stoop of the Cadet Administration
Building and listened to acid instructions. The talk
dealt with the proper manner of reporting for duty.
The tone of it, however, showed the processor’s profound
doubt of the “dum-dums’” ability to do anything
properly. It was deliberately maddening.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake felt a wave of hot resentment sweep
over him. A second later cool reason met it and
drove it back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They’re just trying to see if we underclassmen
can take it,” he told himself. “A cadet’s got to learn
how to be an officer and a gentleman, in <i>any</i> situation.
They’re teaching us the quick, hard way, that’s
all!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry held his tough, well-proportioned muscles a
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>little less stiffly. He wondered how Chick Enders was
taking the processor’s verbal jabs. From where he
stood he could see Chick’s short, bandy-legged figure
quiver under the barrage of upperclass sarcasm.
Chick’s good-natured mouth was a hard line, and his
eyes were pale blue slits above his pug nose. The
homely cadet was having a hard job trying not to
explode.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly he relaxed, and Barry, seeing it, chuckled
inwardly. He had known Chick Enders since they
were both in kindergarten. When he got angry, the
kid’s blond bristles would stick up like the fuzz of a
newly hatched chick. That always meant a fight, unless
Chick’s sense of humor got the upper hand, as it
had just now.</p>

<p class='c014'>While the processor’s stinging remarks continued,
Barry’s memory flashed back to the day that he
and Chick had graduated from the Craryville High
School. Barry had been valedictorian of the class,
and Chick, he recalled, had been prouder of the fact
than anyone.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was an almost hound-like loyalty in the
homely youth’s soul, and his hero was Barry Blake.
From their earliest snow-ball battles to high school
and varsity games where Barry carried the ball and
Chick ran interference, it had always been the same.
Both had enlisted at the same time and later applied
for flying cadet training.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m glad we’re still together,” Barry thought, with
another glance at his friend’s freckled profile. “If
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>he’d been sent to any other basic training school than
Randolph Field, I’m afraid it would have broken
Chick’s heart. We’ll be together here for nine weeks.
After that—well, there’s a war on. We’ll train and
fight wherever we’re sent, with no complaints....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“All right, you Misters!” the upperclassman’s voice
broke in on Barry’s thoughts. “Right, face! Column
right, march! You’ll receive your company and room
assignments upstairs. <i>Try</i> not to forget them!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Still under a running fire of orders and caustic
comments, the suffering “dum-dums” were taken to
the supply room. Here each new cadet proceeded to
draw a full outfit of bedding, clothing, and equipment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I feel like a walking department store!” Chick
Enders muttered as he joined the line behind Barry.
“They must have figured out scientifically just how
much a guy can carry if he uses his ten fingers, his
elbows and his teeth....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Roll up your flaps, Mister!” snapped a keen-eared
processor, taking a step toward Chick. “You’ll get
your chance to sound off soon enough!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Just in time Chick caught and straightened out an
apologetic grin. He had a hunch that <i>any</i> smile just
now would be asking for trouble. Pulling his freckled
face even longer than usual, he stepped out at
Barry’s heels, and hoped that none of his assorted
burdens would slip.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the barracks, while changing into coveralls and
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>new shoes, Barry and Chick were able to exchange a
few hurried words.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’d heard that these upperclassmen were pretty
unsympathetic,” the homely cadet remarked, “but I
never thought they’d lay it on quite so heavy. I guess
they stay awake nights inventing ways to make a
dum-dum sweat.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t let it get under your skin, Chick,” Barry
laughed. “There’s no meanness behind their processing.
It’s intended to make soldiers out of us. The
first thing they do is to prick our balloons—take the
conceit out of us, if we have any.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And the next thing is to toughen us up,” grinned
Hap Newton, their roommate. “Don’t worry—in
five weeks <i>we’ll</i> be processing a new bunch of dum-dums,
and making ’em like it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Before they had finished changing clothes the
processor in charge bellowed another order.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hit the ramp, you Misters!” he shouted. “On the
double! Leave your powder and lipstick till tonight.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake grabbed his cap. He headed for the
doorway, tightening his belt as he went.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come on, Chick,” he said. “I don’t know what
the ramp is yet, but I aim to hit it hard and quick.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Me too,” his friend grunted, “even if I lose a
shoe.... Mine aren’t laced up yet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The ramp, they discovered, was the broad stretch
of concrete just outside the cadet barracks. Pouring
out of the door, the dum-dums were greeted by rapid-fire
commands:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>“Fall in! Dress, <i>right</i>! Straighten-that-line-d’you-think-this-is-a-
ring-around-the-rosy? ’Ten-<i>shun</i>!
Count off! Forwar-r-rd, march! Hup, hup, hup!
Column right, march! Column left, march! By the
right flank, march! To the re-ar-r-r, <i>march</i>! Squa-a-ad,
<i>halt</i>! Left, face! About, face! Forward,
march!”</p>

<p class='c014'>To Barry and Chick, both assigned to Squad 17,
these maneuvers were a welcome change. Having
mastered close-order drill at primary school, they
now went through it automatically. Their taut
nerves relaxed. The stiff soles of their new issue
shoes were just beginning to smart, when a hollow
voice boomed through the air.</p>

<p class='c014'>“’Tenshun all squads now drilling!” whooped the
invisible giant. “Squad 26! Take Squad 26 to the
tailor shop.... Squad 17. Take Squad 17 to the
barber shop. That is all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was the voice of the Field’s public address system.
Instantly the processors in charge of the two
squads named marched them off the drilling area.
As Squad 17 entered the shop, six barbers stood waiting
by their chairs. Barry got a quick mental picture
of sheep being driven to the shearing pen.</p>

<p class='c014'>First in line was a sulky-looking youth, whose
name-tag proclaimed him to be Glenn Cardiff Crayle.
He had a sleek black pompadour, and a habit of
passing his hand caressingly over it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Just trim the sides and neck, please,” Barry heard
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>him mutter to the wielder of the shears.</p>

<p class='c014'>The barber exchanged winks with the upperclassman
in charge. He slipped expert fingers under a
long lock of Crayle’s hirsute pride.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Maybe you’d better have it regulation, sir,” he
suggested with heavy emphasis.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Snip-snip-snip</i> went the shears. Cadet Crayle
writhed as if they were a savage’s scalping knife, but
he knew he was helpless. Barry Blake chuckled inwardly.
“Regulation length” would mean no loss to
his own short, wavy hair, or to Chick’s blond bristles.</p>

<p class='c014'>Six barbers and ten minutes for a haircut! In little
more than a quarter of an hour, Squad 17 was
marching back to the drilling area. Another half
hour of close-order drill—then dinner formation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Scarcely were they seated in the big cadet mess
hall, when the nervous dum-dums found their worst
suspicions realized. Mealtime was just another opportunity
for hazing by the upperclassmen. Placed
at the foot of a table seating eleven men, Barry and
Chick discovered that they were the “gunners” of
the group. That is, they must pass—“gun” or “shoot”—food
and drink up the table whenever asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>Two minutes after the meal began, the “table
commander” at the upper end sent down his coffee
cup for re-filling.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A cup of coffee for Mr. Danvers,” murmured the
lowerclassman nearest him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A cup of coffee for Mr. Danvers,” repeated Hap
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>Newton as he passed the cup.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A cup of coffee for Mr. Danvers,” Barry Blake
solemnly announced, as he filled it and passed it back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You, Mister!” the table commander barked, looking
straight at Chick Enders. “The potato dish is
empty. You will signal the waiter by holding it up—like
this.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With his upper arm horizontal and his forearm
vertical, the upperclassman demonstrated the proper
gesture. Hap Newton giggled.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Silence!” snapped the processor. “What’s your
name? Newton? Sit forward on your chair, Mister—on
the first four inches. Chin up, get some altitude.
And take your left hand off the table. And <i>remember</i>—for
a dum-dum to laugh, smile or chortle at
mess is an inexcusable breach of manners.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, sir,” mumbled Hap Newton, so meekly that
Chick Enders nearly dropped the potato dish, trying
not to laugh.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dinner ended all too soon for most of the hungry
new cadets. The food was ample, but so excellent
that the time seemed too short to do it justice. At
the close of the noon hour, Squad 17 was issued
rifles, and plunged into the monotonous manual of
arms. Not until evening did the weary dum-dums
have time to relax.</p>

<p class='c014'>Their first day at Randolph Field had been a full
one—crammed with new impressions that would
whirl through their dreams that night.</p>

  <h2 id='chap02' class='c015'>CHAPTER TWO</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>TWO KINDS OF RATS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The weeks that followed were more crowded than
any Barry Blake had known. Drills, monotonous,
tiring, but excellent for physical “tone,” occupied
the first few days. On Monday of the second week
the regular training schedule began.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mornings were devoted to Ground School. Barry
and Chick put their best into it, knowing that study
was vital to passing later tests. There were five subjects:
Airplane and Engine Operation, Weather, Military
Law, Navigation, and Radio Code. Of them
all, Barry Blake preferred the first. His hobby had
been flying model planes since he was in short pants.</p>

<p class='c014'>The classroom in Hangar V with its blueprints,
charts, takedown and working models made him feel
at home. Here he “ate up” every lecture on Fuel
Systems, Motors, Electric Systems, Engine Instruments,
Wheels, and Brakes. The floor of the great
hangar itself Barry found still more fascinating. Here
were displayed the real planes and their parts, with
cutaway and breakdown views. They gave him his
first intimate contact with the powerful, fighting
ships that he hoped soon to fly.</p>

<p class='c014'>Flight instruction, in the BT-9 and BT-14 training
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>planes, was always a mixture of anxieties and thrills.
There was much to learn, and little time to learn it.
In these ships, twice as big as the primary school
“kites,” the speeds were higher, the controls more
quickly responsive. The gadgets on the instrument
panels were just double in number. And the instructors—!</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lieutenant Baird has it in for me, Barry,” Chick
Enders confided, as they headed down the concrete
apron toward their ships. “No matter what I do, he
just sits back and sulks. All the encouragement I’ve
had from him is a grunt or a glare—ever since the day
I taxied into the wrong stall with my flaps down.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A step or two behind him, Barry glanced down at
Chick’s short legs twinkling below the bobbing bustle
of his ’chute. In spite of himself Barry chuckled.
The idea that anybody could “have it in for” a fellow
as homely and likeable as Chick was just too funny.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps Lieutenant Baird has other troubles,” he
suggested. “Remember, when your flight period begins
he has already spent an hour with a hot pilot by
the name of Glenn Crayle. That lad is enough to
curdle the milk of human kindness in any instructor.
I wouldn’t worry about it, Chick. You passed your
twenty-hour test all right, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yeah,” Chick admitted. “Maybe it is Crayle, more
than I, who’s responsible for the lieutenant’s sour
puss. Crayle’s a born show-off and a sorehead as well.
Even the processors couldn’t prick his bubble, and
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>they tried—oh-oh! G-gosh! I—er—hello, Crayle! I—uh—didn’t
see you coming.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Walking fast, Cadet Crayle passed the two friends
with a glare. They turned and watched him disappear
into the Operations Office. Chick Enders let out
his breath in a long whistle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He must have heard all we said about him before
he zoomed past us,” Barry said, with a dry smile.
“Oh, well! It’s the truth, and it <i>may</i> do him good
when he thinks it over.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Practicing his <i>chandelles</i> that afternoon, Chick
gave less thought to his instructor’s sour mood. As a
result he did better than usual. Barry Blake, for his
part, forgot the incident completely. It was not until
special room inspection, the following Saturday
morning, that he recalled Crayle’s ugly look.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake was room orderly that week. This
meant that he alone was responsible for the general
neatness of the quarters he shared with Chick and
Hap Newton. For ordinary morning and evening
inspection the preparations were simple. Beds must
be made, the room must be swept and dusted, and
everything had to be in its proper place.</p>

<p class='c014'>On Saturday, however, all three roommates pitched
into the work. Everything must be in perfect, regulation
order—each blanket edge laid just so, each
speck of dust wiped up. Shoes, clothing, equipment
must be spotless, or demerits would fall like rain.</p>

<p class='c014'>To make sure that Barry had overlooked nothing
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>in his dusting, Chick and Hap went over the furniture
with their fingers, searching for a smear of dust.
They found none, until Hap tried the bottom of the
waste basket.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Two ‘gigs’ for you, Mister Blake—if the inspecting
officer had found that,” he remarked, with a wink
at Chick.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’re dead right, Hap,” Chick spoke up, wiping
his finger over the same spot. “The inspecting officer
will do it with white gloves, you know. And if
he gets a smear—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aw, drive it in the hangar, fellows!” Barry protested
with a grin. “Give me that waste basket and
a rag. And then go wash your own hands.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Okay—but not in the washbowl <i>I’ve</i> just finished
cleaning!” retorted Hap. “It’s too near inspection
time. I’m going down the hall.... Coming, Chick?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry polished the bottom of the waste basket as
if it were brass. As he put the cleaning rag away, he
glanced about him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If this room were to be any cleaner, it would have
to be sterilized,” he declared. “Bring on your white
gloves, and let’s see what they can find now. Guess
I’ll have just time to join Chick and Hap down the
hall and get back before inspection.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The three roommates had figured almost too close.
They were just starting back to their room when
call to quarters sounded. As they hurried into the
hall, a uniformed figure darted across the farther
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>end.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Say!” hissed Chick Enders. “Didn’t that mister
come from <i>our room</i>?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I thought so,” muttered Barry. “He <i>looked</i> like
Glenn Crayle! I wonder....”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no time for more speculation then.
Official footsteps were approaching. The three cadets
were just able to reach their room and stiffen at attention
by their beds before the inspecting party
came in view.</p>

<p class='c014'>The officer in charge was Captain Branch, whose
piercing black eyes had never been known to miss
a spot of dirt. Square-jawed, quick-moving, he entered
the room accompanied by a cadet officer with
notebook and pencil. His thin, sensitive nostrils
sniffed the air.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who,” he asked sharply, “has been smoking here
within the last few minutes? The room smells foul!”</p>

<p class='c014'>A tense, five-second silence followed. Barry Blake
broke it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know, sir,” he managed to say. “It was
none of us three. We don’t use tobacco.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The muscles of the captain’s jaw bulged. The
thin line of his lips hardened.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is your idea in leaving rolls of dust under
your bed at inspection?” he demanded bitterly. “And
dirty soap on your washbowl? And that can of foot
powder on the desk? And that drawer—”</p>

<p class='c014'>He broke off, to stride across the room. From the
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>crack of a drawer in Barry’s desk drifted a tiny feather
of smoke. Captain Branch jerked it open. There, on
a charred paper, lay a smouldering cigar.</p>

<p class='c014'>With his face like a marble mask, the officer tossed
the cigar into the washbowl.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Gentlemen,” he said heavily. “This is an idiotic
defiance of authority. Unless you can clear yourselves
immediately in a written report, appropriate
punishment must follow. That is all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Not until the captain was out of hearing did the
roommates dare to look about. Then, with a sigh
that told more than words, Barry stooped and picked
up two big, fuzzy “rats” of dust. Wordless, Chick
Enders took the can of foot powder from the desk
and wiped up what had been spilled.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hap Newton groaned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was Crayle, all right,” he declared. “I recognized
him by the way he carries his head.... But
<i>why</i>? Why should he want to sabotage <i>us</i>?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think I know,” said Barry. “Two days ago he
overheard Chick and me talking about him. What
we said was true enough, as this frame-up proves—that
Crayle is a sorehead, with an inflated ego.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Inflated and inflamed, both!” Chick Enders exclaimed.
“He’s always trying to tell what a hot pilot
he is. He hates anybody who shows him up.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A hard grin stretched Hap’s wide, good-natured
mouth.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>“We’ll show him up for a sneaking rat,” he said.
“Nose up to the desk, fellows, and we’ll get busy on
that written report....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pull out of it, Hap!” Barry Blake interrupted.
“We’ll only do a ground loop that way. Our best
maneuver is to say nothing about Crayle and take
our medicine. We can’t prove a thing against him,
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hap Newton’s jaw dropped. He sat down hard on
his chair.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You-you’re crazy, Blake!” he gasped. “We’re
likely to be dismissed from Randolph for what’s happened
this morning. Why should we sacrifice our
wings, our reputation—everything we value here—to
protect a yellow snake-in-the-grass like Crayle? That’s
what it will mean!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ve circumstantial evidence that Crayle did
it,” Chick Enders put in. “He had no business in
our quarters. And it <i>would</i> have been idiotic for us
to stand inspection in a room as raunchy as this, if
we could help it. That ought to be plain to anybody.
Get your pen and paper out, Barry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Seated at the desk, Barry Blake shook his head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We won’t make anything plain by accusing Glenn
Crayle, fellows,” he stated. “That mister may be a
fool in some ways, but he’s covered his tracks. Remember,
we only <i>thought</i> that he came from our
room. And, from the captain’s viewpoint, it would
be natural for us to accuse someone else if we were
guilty.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>Barry let those points sink into his roommates’
minds for a full minute.</p>

<p class='c014'>“On the other hand,” he went on, “suppose we
face the music. That is what Captain Branch would
expect us to do if we were innocent and had no
proof. We’ll pay a stiff penalty, of course, but I don’t
think we’ll be dismissed from the Field.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hap Newton rose and stared out of the window.
Chick Enders passed nervous fingers through his
short, tow-colored hair.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’re right as always, Barry,” the homely cadet
said finally. “There’s a paragraph in ‘Compass Headings’
that says: ‘<i>Flying Cadets do not make excuses.</i>’
I have a hunch we’ll be doing punishment tours for
the rest of our course, but I’m ready to suffer in silence.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hap Newton grumbled and fumed, but he, too,
gave in.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll get even with Crayle,” he added vengefully.
“I’ll fix him—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No you won’t, Hap,” Barry cut in, “unless you’re
willing to fly at his level. The ceiling’s zero down
there. Come out of the clouds, fella! And help us
clean this room for the second time today.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>JEEP JITTERS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp! Up the long concrete
ramp—halt—about face—and back again. One
hundred and twenty steps to the minute, thirty
inches to each step—a fast walk, in civilian life. But
these three, covering a prescribed beat at widely
spaced intervals, marching in silence and without
pause, are not civilians. Not by a long shot!</p>

<p class='c014'>They are Flying Cadets Blake, Enders, and Newton,
wearing the uniform of the day, with field belt,
bayonet scabbard and white gloves. Their penalty
for a dirty room is posted on the company bulletin
board: five tours and six “gigs,” or demerits, apiece.
That’s a lot easier than they expected. Still, a “tour”
lasts one hour and covers almost four miles. They
have three hours still to go.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>And Glenn Crayle’s enjoying ‘open post’!</i> Right
now that mister is doubtless disporting himself with
some sweet young thing at a tea dance in the San
Antonio Flying Cadet Club.... Tramp, tramp,
tramp.... Here’s where the ‘gig’ dodger ought to
be! One of these days, he’ll slip up....”</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c014'>Glenn Crayle never became a “touring cadet,”
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>however. In small, clever ways he continued to work
out his grudge against Chick and Barry. One of his
bright tricks was to dust itching powder over the
stick of the “Jeep,” or Link Trainer, knowing that
Chick Enders would be the next to handle it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The “Jeep” is a marvellous device to teach aviation
cadets the art of flying by instruments—without
ever leaving the ground. Entering it, the fledgling
pilot finds himself in a cockpit like that of a real
plane. Before him is an instrument panel. Above
him an opaque canopy shuts off his view of everything
else. In his closed cockpit are all the familiar
controls. His situation is the same as if he were flying
through clouds at night.</p>

<p class='c014'>Poor Chick had a case of “Jeep jitters” from the
moment he started his “flight” under the hood. The
little moving ball and the two queer little needles
simply <i>would</i> not stay in place. According to his
instruments he dropped one wing and went into a
“spit curl” or side slip that cost him precious altitude.
Correcting it, he over-controlled. Dangerously
close to Mother Earth, according to the Jeep’s altimeter,
he zoomed, stalled, and theoretically crashed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Climbing (in theory) to five thousand feet, Chick
attempted once more to conquer the “jeepkrieg.”
For some moments he succeeded. Then, without
warning, his hand on the stick began to itch. He
stood it as long as he dared, let go for one second of
frantic scratching—and was lost.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>Fifty feet from the theoretical ground he pulled
out of his dive. He hedge-hopped over some imaginary
trees, caught the stick between his knees, and
tried to climb while scratching. Result—a third crash.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I give up!” gurgled Chick, slamming back the
canopy and bouncing out to the surprise of his instructor.
“The thing has given me hives on my
hands, sir. I’ve committed suicide three times by the
altimeter, and I’m afraid I’ll do it in earnest!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The instructor glanced at Chick’s reddened palm
and snorted.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, Mister,” he snapped. “Spin off and
get control of your nerves. You can try it again tomorrow
when you’re out of the storm. But you’ll
never learn instrument flying by mauling the stick
the way you did just now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Within the week Chick had mastered the art of
level “flight” in a “Jeep.” Yet he knew that his itch-inspired
tantrum stood against his record as a prospective
pilot of warplanes. The men who fly the
Army’s fighting ships must have nerves of chilled
steel. Those who might crack under the strain of air
combat must be weeded out.</p>

<p class='c014'>Second thought told Chick that Glenn Crayle must
have doctored the “Jeep’s” stick. No hive ever itched
as wickedly as his palm; <i>and Crayle was using the
trainer just before him</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll call that rat out for boxing practice, and work
him over,” the angry cadet told Barry. “Crayle may
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>outweigh me, but I’ll whittle him down to my size.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“If you did,” Barry Blake pointed out, “he’d still
win, according to his twisted way of thinking. Crayle
knows that open grudges are frowned on here at the
Field. If you let yourself get mad enough to beat
him up, your supervising officer will put <i>that</i> down
to poor control, too, Chick. Another show of nerves
might wash you out as a pilot—for good. Stick it out,
man! The sixty-hour test is only a week away.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The sixty-hour progress test is a landmark, warning
the Randolph Field Cadet that his basic training
is nearly over. Sixty hours of flight training have
been accomplished. All fundamental flying movements
have been mastered, of course, at primary flying
school. At Randolph Field they have become still
more familiar. Climbing turns, steep turns, “lazy
eights,” and forced landings have been learned and
practiced thoroughly. Now the pilot’s ability to fly
by instruments alone is to be judged.</p>

<p class='c014'>Both Barry and Chick Enders had worked hard
to perfect themselves in flying “under the hood.”
The test should have held no terrors for either of
them. Yet, as the hour approached, Chick grew
nervous. He knew that his instructors were watching
him for signs of another explosion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll have to be extra good today,” he told his
roommates, as the three donned their coveralls that
afternoon. “Captain Branch just had me in the office
for a little talk. I’m worried, fellows.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>“I noticed that you were sort of ‘riding the beam’
when you came into the locker room,” Hap Newton
said, picking up his parachute. “Eyes fixed on vacancy,
expression of a calf in a butcher’s cart, and all
that. ’Smatter, Chick—did he bawl you out?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, Hap, he was kind—too kind entirely. Reminded
me of a sympathetic executioner. He’s flying
with me on this test—in his own washing machine.
If he so much as coughs when we get ‘upstairs’ I’ll
probably reef back the stick and go into a stall....
Well, wish me happy landings. I’m taking off.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake shook his head gloomily at Chick’s
departing figure.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The kid’s in a storm already,” he muttered to
Hap. “If Chick were the best gadgeteer on the Field
he’d never pass a test under the hood with that case
of jitters.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Instrument flying will show jumpy nerves every
time,” Hap agreed. “It’s tough, Barry. The whole
thing started when Glenn Crayle doped the ‘Jeep’
stick with itching powder. Of all the lowdown,
squirmy tricks, that was the worst! And he’ll be
tickled half to death if Chick is washed out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake was so upset about his friend that his
own nerves were none too steady. When he stepped
into the cockpit, however, he took a firm grip on
himself. Glenn Crayle, he vowed, should not have
the laugh on two of them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry was a born flier. Once in the air, he lost
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>every trace of jitters. His performance was better
than ever. He passed the test with a high mark, and
brought his instructor back smiling. Hap Newton,
who landed soon after, also passed without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where’s Chick?” the latter asked, the moment
they were alone.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Still flying,” Barry said shortly. “There comes
his ship. Flight Commander Branch must have been
giving him an extra-thorough test.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The two friends watched Chick’s ship come in for
the landing. With engine cut off, it glided down.
The wheels bumped—bounced—came down again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He’s heading for the hay,” Hap Newton yelled, as
Chick’s plane slewed around. “Give her the gun,
Chick!”</p>

<p class='c014'>As if his frantic shout had actually been heard,
Chick’s engine roared into life. The ship leaped into
the air, and climbed like a cat with a dog after her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That washing machine must have developed a
wobbly tail wheel,” Barry muttered; “or maybe it
was a freak breeze that caught him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Shucks, Barry,” Hap answered unhappily.
“There’s no use making excuses for him. Chick’s still
got the jeep jitters. He’s as good as washed out now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not if he lands okay this time,” Barry said.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chick’s plane banked, turned, and came down the
base leg with open throttle. The engine cut out. A
wing dropped slightly, to counteract the drift of the
light wind. So far, Chick was handling her nicely.
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>At just the right second he lifted her nose a little to
make a three-point landing. The tires touched....</p>

<p class='c014'>And then it happened. The tail swung sharply.
Chick, feeling it, cracked open his throttle, but he
was a split second too late. The plane swapped ends,
pivoting on a wing. Dust spurted from the runway.
With a splintering, ripping crash the wing gave way.
The plane nosed over, propeller biting the dirt.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry groaned, and started running before the
dust began to settle. From West B. Street came the
clanging of the ambulance and the crash truck. From
the length of the West Flying Line men were running,
each with an ugly picture in his mind’s eye—<i>fire</i>!</p>

<p class='c014'>But neither smoke nor flame appeared. Instead,
two helmeted figures crawled out of the wreckage.
For a moment they stared at each other. Then, shaking
his head, the Flight Commander walked away.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake caught Chick roughly by the arm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Snap out of it, man!” he whispered. “Crayle’s
here in the crowd, laughing himself sick. Reef back
and gain some altitude! Chin up!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Except for Crayle, few of the cadets about the
plane were laughing. From the look that Captain
Branch had given Enders, they sensed that this was
no ordinary ground-loop that would qualify Chick
for the Stupid Pilot’s Trophy. It was the tragedy
that all cadet pilots dread—the wash-out.</p>

    <div>LIEUTENANT RIP VAN WINKLE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Chick’s actual elimination from basic training
school did not occur for a few days. Captain Branch’s
recommendation had to be confirmed by the Stage
Commander, who first flew with the unhappy cadet
in a final test. His report, duly filed with those of
Chick’s instructors and his Flight Commander, must
be reviewed at the next meeting of the elimination
board. All this took time.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the evening before Chick was to hear the verdict,
Barry and Hap made a special effort to cheer
him up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Being ‘washed out’ is no disgrace, fella,” Barry
told him. “It doesn’t mean that you’re kicked out
of the Air Forces—only that you can’t be a pilot.
You’ll get your officer’s commission just the same, in
some other classification. So why worry?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Chick’s homely face cracked in a wan smile. He
had not regained his natural color since the ground-loop
that wrecked his plane. The freckles stood out
more plainly than usual on his snub nose.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope you’re right, Barry,” he said huskily. “It’s
only ‘under the hood’ that I go to pieces. Ever since
that time I got the itch in the Link Trainer, instrument
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>flying gives me the jitters. If it doesn’t carry
over to advanced training school....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It won’t, Chick,” Hap Newton assured him
stoutly. “What course have you picked for a first
choice—Photography, Navigation, or Communications?
You’re better than most in ‘buzzer’ code. Why
don’t you ask for the advanced course in radio?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That would be my second choice, Hap,” Enders
replied. “Bombardment’s my preference, though.
Next to being a pilot, I’d like to dish it out to the
enemy in big, explosive chunks. I’ve already told
Captain Branch. He’ll put in a good word for me.
And, listen, you bums! Don’t think I haven’t appreciated
the way you’ve helped. A man’s got no right
to be downhearted with a couple of friends like you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The next day Chick came into the room with a
broad grin.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bombardment school for me!” he announced.
“I’m leaving tonight. The board didn’t question
Captain Branch’s recommendation. Now it’s all settled,
I’m almost as happy as if I’d passed all my pilot
tests. Only thing I hate is leaving you fellows, and—and
the grand bunch of officers that we’ve had here
at the Field. They tried to make me feel as if <i>they</i>
didn’t like to say good-by, either.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They meant it, Chick!” Barry Blake exclaimed
softly. “Student pilots aren’t just so much grist
through the mill—not as our teaching officers see us.
They’re real and personal friends of each cadet
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>who’ll meet them halfway. It’s a big honor to know
men like that!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Parting with Chick Enders was a hard wrench for
his roommates. As he boarded the bus for San Antonio
that evening, they realized that they might be
seeing him for the last time. In a world war of many
fronts only a rare coincidence would bring them all
together again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Happy landings, you goons!” Chick gulped as
he gripped their hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pick your targets, fella—and remember us when
you’re dropping block-busters on Tokyo!” Barry
replied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yeh, we’ll be right behind you with some more
of ’em!” grinned Hap Newton, as the bus door
slammed shut.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c014'>A few days after Chick’s departure for bombardier
school, graduation separated the two remaining
roommates. Barry, whose cool, quick brain and
steady nerves would have fitted him for either fighter
or bombardment flying, was allowed to choose the
latter. Hap Newton’s one hundred and eighty-five
pounds removed him automatically from the pursuit
class. Recommended to twin engine school at Ellington
Field, he said good-by to Barry in the Flying
Cadets’ Club in San Antonio.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll keep in touch, Hap,” Barry promised.
“And there’s just a chance we’ll meet up before this
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>war is over. Keep eager, you stick-mauler! I’m taking
off for Kelly Field now!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Set ’em down easy, you old sky-jazzer!” Hap
smiled. “If you don’t, I’ll come along and lay an egg
right on your tail assembly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake strode away with a lump in his throat.
He’d have to get used to parting with good friends,
he told himself. The Air Forces were like that. Sometimes
a flier had to watch his squadron members
torch down under enemy fire. That was a lot tougher
than shaking hands for the last time, with a grin and
a wisecrack. Time to lay a new course, now—for
Kelly Field and a pair of silver wings!</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c014'>For Barry, the nine weeks at Kelly Field passed
even more swiftly than those at Randolph. His
acquaintance among his fellow cadets widened considerably.
Yet, perhaps unconsciously, he avoided
making friends so intimate that good-bys would be
painful.</p>

<p class='c014'>From training planes he graduated to handling the
steady, reliable B-25 bombers. Taking off, flying and
landing these medium bombers presented problems
quite different from those he had met at Randolph
Field. Barry caught on quickly. Gathering every
scrap of skill he had ever learned, his mind “sensed”
the right maneuver, the correct touch on each control.</p>

<div id='fig02'  class='figcenter id006'>
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
<img src='images/barryblake_p37.jpg' alt='' class='ig006' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p><i>Barry Learned the Correct Touch on Each Control</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>“You’re cut out for a Fortress pilot, Blake,” his
instructor told him. “You’re naturally methodical.
At the same time you’re as quick to grasp a new
emergency as any cadet I’ve ever seen. Tomorrow
you’ll shift to the old B-17. She has no tail turret,
but for training purposes she handles like the newer
types.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry was more thrilled than he cared to show.
Since pre-flight school, he had envied the pilots who
flew the big flying forts—the famous B-17F’s. When
the hour came that he actually sat at the controls of
his Fortress, he knew beyond all doubt that these
were the ships for him. The quadruple thunder of
the bomber’s 4,800 horses was sweeter in his ears
than a pipe-organ fugue.</p>

<p class='c014'>First, in the co-pilot’s seat, he learned the exact
touch needed on the throttles, the turbos, the r.p.m.
adjustment, to keep the winged giant’s airspeed constant.
This, for accurate bombing, would be a most
important factor. Next, he learned exactly how to
follow the Boeing’s P. D. I., or pilot director indicator,
which kept the ship straight on her course with
not the slightest change of altitude, while the bombardier
sighted his target.</p>

<p class='c014'>His final lessons included setting down and taking
off on small, rough fields. Under war conditions
many a bomber pilot has escaped destruction by
knowing just what his ship can do in a pinch. Barry
Blake was now as ready as any training school could
make him.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>What he longed for now was actual combat—the
take-off before dawn on a real bombing mission—the
swift descent on the enemy city, camp, or convoy—the
blasting of his bombs on the target—the sight of
enemy fighter planes falling apart before his ship’s
guns.</p>

<p class='c014'>But where would it be? Europe, Africa, the South
Pacific, or the Aleutian chain?</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry had hoped for a few days’ furlough after
receiving his commission. A week at home would be
like a taste of paradise after these seven crowded
months. Even five days with Dad and Mom and the
kid sister would be worth the heartache of saying
good-by again. Yet, at the last moment, he learned
that this was not to be.</p>

<p class='c014'>Like a flooding tide the mighty crest of America’s
war effort was sweeping everything before it. More
planes than ever were needed at the fighting front.
More planes were going there—and that meant more
pilots. Twenty-four hours was the limit of Barry
Blake’s time at home.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was all like a dream. Walking up Craryville’s
old main street, Barry felt like a beardless Rip Van
Winkle. He had left there a green kid of eighteen.
Now, an inch taller and ten pounds heavier, he
passed neighbors who didn’t know him—until he
spoke. And, speaking to them, he hardly knew himself.
Professor Blake’s gangling offspring, who’d
been the high school valedictorian, who had jerked
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>sodas on Saturdays in the corner drug store—what
had that self-conscious kid in common with Lieutenant
Barry Blake, pilot of multi-engined bombing
planes?</p>

<p class='c014'>There was Mom and Dad. He’d never be different
to them, or they to him. To the kid sister, he was a
hero, of course, but Betty was only fourteen. She’d
changed, too, in the past seven months. Barry wondered
what in the world she’d be like when he came
back again, after the war ... if he <i>did</i> come back.
There wasn’t time for such thoughts, though. Half
of his twenty-four hour visit was gone already!</p>

<p class='c014'>When the train pulled out of Craryville next
morning, Barry the high school kid was only a dim
memory in the mind of Lieutenant Blake. His orders
were to report at Seattle, Washington, where he
would join the crew of a new B-17F as co-pilot. It
was better, far better, to keep his thoughts fixed on
that. Otherwise, recalling the good-bys just ended
would be a bit too much to bear.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>SWEET ROSY O’GRADY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>His pulses pounding with excitement, Barry Blake
gazed across the long runways of Boeing Field at his
first fighting ship. The great Flying Fortress seemed
to perch lightly on the ground, despite her twenty-odd
tons. Her propellers were turning slowly, glinting
in the sun like the blades of four gigantic sword
dancers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Despite her drab coat of Army paint Barry
thought her beautiful. The slim, torpedo-like profile,
the high, strong sweep of her tail assembly—even the
fishy grin produced by her bombardier’s window
and forward gun ports—thrilled her young co-pilot
to the core. This was the ship of his dreams. Her
name, <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i>, was painted just above
her transparent nose.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hurrying forward, he saluted the long-legged,
lean-faced pilot who stood by the <i>Rosy’s</i> armed tail.</p>

<p class='c014'>The lengthy captain looked up from the postcard
he was scribbling. He lifted a nonchalant hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’re Lieutenant Blake?” he said with a Texas
drawl. “The rest of our crew are all here, getting
acquainted with the ship. I was just dashing off a
card to the real Rosy O’Grady—my wife. It’s finished.
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>Come in and meet the others. Then we’ll be
ready to take off.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Inside the big bomber, Captain O’Grady introduced
Barry to the six other members of the crew.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Meet Lieutenant Aaron Levitt, better known as
Curly,” the skipper invited. “He’s the smartest, and
probably the handsomest, ex-lawyer in the Air Forces.
Born in Manhattan.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lower East Side,” Levitt added, giving Barry a
cordial handclasp and a keen look. “Happy that
you’re going to be one of us, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“... and this gent is our bombardier, Sergeant
Daniel Hale. He’s of the old time Texas breed, in
spite of hailing from Arizona and looking more like
a shorthorn bull. His great-granddad died fighting
in the Alamo.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry pulled what was left of his hand from Sergeant
Hale’s bone-crushing grip and turned to “Sergeant
Fred Marmon of Glens Falls, New York—the
head nurse in charge of <i>Rosy’s</i> roaring quadruplets.”
The red-haired engineer-gunner chuckled as
he acknowledged Barry’s greeting.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Boy!” he exclaimed. “And do those 1200 horsepower
babies keep a man busy! Some of ’em, that
is. One engine will run like a dream for fifty or a
hundred hours. Another will develop more ailments
than a motherless child. I’m hoping these new engines
will be the first kind, Lieutenant. If not—well,
here are Sergeants Cracker Jackson and Soapy Babbitt
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>to help me out. They’re our top-turret and belly
gunners, but they know a lot about aerial power
plants, too.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Last of all, Barry Blake met Tony Romani, the
pint-sized tail gunner. The little corporal was as
friendly as could be, but his sad, Latin eyes seemed
to hold all the cares and worries which his crew
mates laughingly discarded.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was already hurrying back to his turret when
Captain Tex O’Grady said, “Okay, boys! We’ll take
her upstairs! I’ll mail this postcard to Mrs. O’Grady
from Salt Lake City. If you have any letters to send
you can drop them there. We’re heading west to the
Orient.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>Rosy’s</i> four big engines deepened their song
of power as she rushed down the runway. She was
a living, throbbing organism, but her personality
was yet to be learned. Newly fledged from Boeing’s
great hatchery of warbirds, she had still to get acquainted
with her crew, and they with her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake sat alert in his co-pilot’s seat, checking
the instruments, as the runway dropped away below
him. At the skipper’s nod, he touched the lever that
retracted the landing gear. He heard the wheels
wind up with a smooth mechanical whine, and noted
the time it took in seconds. Again he moved the
lever, letting the wheels down and raising them back
in place. He tested the action of the flaps, the engines’
response to their throttles, the revolutions-per-minute
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>of the props. In everything the <i>Rosy O’Grady</i>
behaved as sweetly as any lady with such a name
should do.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Salt Lake City there was a short stop; then on
they flew to San Antonio. Again Barry glimpsed the
familiar countryside over which he and Chick Enders
and Hap Newton had flown. The perfect green pattern
of Randolph Field, with three or four flights of
planes swinging over it, brought a homesick pang.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll never forget that scene, Mister,” the voice
of Captain O’Grady broke into Barry’s thoughts. “I
graduated from Randolph ten years ago, but it’s just
like yesterday when I look back.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Those were the happiest weeks of my life,” Barry
replied with a choke in his voice. “I know it now,
though at the time it seemed a tough grind.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Captain O’Grady turned one of his warm Irish
grins on the young co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The real, tough grind,” he said, “will come when
we reach our South Pacific base, I reckon. Barring
accidents, the life of a fortress is about five or six
months on the battlefront. Before it’s over we’ll all
feel like graybeards, kid.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>Rosy</i> made one more stop at Tampa, Florida,
where her engines were thoroughly checked and her
tanks filled. Ahead of her stretched the long hop to
Trinidad, off the northern coast of South America. If
anything should go wrong, there were island bases in
the Caribbean Sea where an emergency landing
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>might be made. But in aviation, an ounce of prevention
is worth many pounds of cure.</p>

<p class='c014'>That evening in Tampa the crew had their last
big restaurant meal for months to come. The following
afternoon they took off despite storm warnings.
There was no long last look at their native land. A
few moments after the <i>Rosy’s</i> wheels had left the runway
she was climbing through a heavy overcast of
clouds.</p>

<p class='c014'>As they roared over the southeastern tip of Cuba
the weather cleared. Below them the Windward Passage
lay, deep blue in the sunlight. Ahead rose the
rugged mountain tops of Haiti.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake felt a strange thrill as he gazed down
into the jungle-clad valleys where not so many years
ago United States Marines had hunted murderous
voodoo worshipers. Somewhere in those dark gorges
bloody voodoo rites were probably being performed
at this very moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>Invisible from the air the Haitian border was left
behind. The dark green ranges of the Dominican
Republic flowed past beneath the <i>Rosy’s</i> wings.
Again the blue Caribbean stretched ahead of her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Crossing the long thousand miles between Haiti
and Trinidad they struck the worst weather yet encountered.
At ten thousand feet the Fortress
slammed into a black storm front.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was worse than anyone had expected. The
tumbling masses of air were like giant fists pummeling
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>the big ship. She bucked like a frightened horse,
reared, stood on her nose, and shuddered.</p>

<p class='c014'>Something struck the right wing from beneath,
flipping the <i>Rosy</i> over on her side, and off course. It
was only air, though it felt to Barry like a collision
with an express train. Tex O’Grady fought the controls
with every ounce of strength in his big body.
Muscles stood out in bunches on his lean jaw. In a
flash of lightning Barry saw sweat streaming down
the pilot’s face.</p>

<p class='c014'>He glanced behind him. Lieutenant Levitt’s teeth
showed in a fixed smile below his little moustache.
In the lightning flashes the whites of his eyes showed
clearly. Sergeant Hale’s big mouth was closed like
a steel trap. Only Fred Marmon, the red-headed
engineer, seemed to be enjoying himself. Meeting
Barry’s eyes he winked, and waggled his fingers in a
mocking gesture.</p>

<p class='c014'>At that moment lightning struck the ship. Every
light went off. The fuselage might have been the
belly of a blasted submarine, pitch dark and battered
by ceaseless depth charges. A beam of light
touched the instrument panel. Barry Blake felt the
cool barrel of a flashlight pressed into his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That will help you keep a check on your instruments!”
Fred Marmon’s shout sounded in his ear.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry was grateful for his first chance to do something,
however small, to help Tex. He watched the
altimeter register a drop of five hundred feet, a
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>steady climb of eight thousand, then another drop.
In this fashion an hour passed.</p>

<p class='c014'>All at once they were out of the storm. Clear
moonlight shone through the plastic windows of the
cockpit. The crew raised a hoarse cheer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Take over, Barry,” drawled Tex O’Grady’s voice.
“I want to find out if I am still in one piece. When
<i>Rosy</i> starts bucking like that she’s tougher than any
bronc I ever forked on my daddy’s ranch in Texas!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Unfastening his safety belt, Captain O’Grady
heaved his lanky frame out of the seat and went back
to talk with the navigator. Barry swept his glance
over the instrument board. He tried the controls,
to feel out any possible storm damage. Satisfied that
there was none, he looked below.</p>

<p class='c014'>A sea of rolling, silvery clouds lay in every direction.
It was beautiful, but menacing. The ceiling
below that overcast, Barry judged, would be zero.
It might hide either land or sea, hills or marshes, for
all that anyone knew. The storm had carried the
<i>Rosy O’Grady</i> a number of miles off her course.</p>

<p class='c014'>The four big engines’ steady drone of power
sounded reassuring, until Barry remembered the last
reading of the gas gauge before the lightning had
knocked it out. There wasn’t enough left for fooling
around, while the <i>Rosy</i> found out where she was.</p>

<p class='c014'>After a few minutes, Captain Tex O’Grady loafed
back to the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The radio’s out,” he told Barry. “That means we
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>can’t get cross bearings to find our position. Curly
Levitt is getting a fix now on some stars. Trouble
is, he’s afraid his octant may have been knocked out
of kilter when it fell off the navigation table, back
there in the storm. Why don’t you go back and cheer
him up?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry thanked the lanky pilot and unfastened his
safety belt. He suspected that O’Grady was just
giving him an opportunity to stretch his legs. If a
fellow needed cheering up, nobody could do a better
job of it than “Old Man” O’Grady himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lieutenant Curly Levitt was up in the top turret
sighting through his instrument when Barry stepped
back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Three stars is enough for a fix,” he shouted above
the engines’ thunder. “Just wait till I shoot Venus.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Better not—it might really be Sirius!” punned
Barry. “Anything I can do to help?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thanks,” replied the navigator, as he prepared
to step down, “Just open your mouth again and I’ll
put my foot in it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry dodged, just in time to tumble over Fred
Marmon who “accidentally” happened to be crouched
just behind him. As he picked himself up, even sad-eyed
Tony Romani laughed. The crew’s tense nerves
were relaxing. Whistling a few bars from <i>Pagliacci</i>,
the mustachioed navigator went back to his desk.</p>

<p class='c014'>Curly Levitt was still a bit worried, however. On
the accuracy of his reckoning depended the life of
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>every man on board. If he failed, the chances were
excellent that <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> would plunge to
a watery grave the moment her gas supply gave out.
At best she would crash in the Venezuelan jungle—unless,
of course, the clouds broke up farther on and
showed her crew a landing field.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Check this reckoning with me, will you, Blake?”
Levitt invited. “Then if there should be an error
we can blame it on the wallop my octant took in the
storm.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Okay!” Barry agreed. “If your octant is off, we’ll
probably find it out too late to help ourselves. So
don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Reckoning the fix is really a simple matter. At a
given time only one point on the earth’s surface can
be directly under any star. Using his octant, the
navigator “shoots” or measures the elevation of two
or more stars, and then figures out just where each
“substellar” point is on the earth’s surface.</p>

<p class='c014'>His next step is still easier. With his substellar
points located on the map, he draws circles around
them. One of the places where these circles intersect
is the place where his plane was at the time the stars
were “shot.” There is no real difficulty in guessing
which intersection is the right one: the others are
apt to be thousands of miles from his last known
position.</p>

<p class='c014'>Everything, of course, depends upon the accuracy
of the star-shooting octant. This expensive and delicate
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>instrument will not always stand abuse such as
Curly Levitt’s had taken. There was reason for the
young ex-lawyer to be worried. He slipped on his
headset and switched on the interphone. The click
in his ears told him that it still worked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pilot from navigator,” he said. “If I’m right
we’re fifty miles due north of Cayo Grande. Our
present compass course would take us just past the
southern tip of Trinidad. That checks pretty well
with my dead reckoning. I haven’t had an accurate
drift reading since we banged into that front.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Navigator from pilot,” came the drawling reply.
“<i>Rosy</i> says she’ll take your word for it. She likes your
style, hombre, even if you <i>are</i> a lily-fingered product
of the effete East. A man who can keep <i>any</i> sort of
dead reckoning in a storm like the one we just rode
through will do to cross the river with.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For the next hour Barry flew the big bomber,
while her “Old Man” dozed in his seat. Below them
the clouds continued unbroken. The moonlight on
their gleaming crests and ridges gave the young co-pilot
a queer sensation. It was hard not to believe
that he was guiding a fantastic ship over the surface
of a strange planet, thousands of light-years from
Earth. In the lightless cockpit nothing seemed real.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You fool—snap out of it!” Barry found himself
muttering. “You’re heading into dreamland with
your throttles wide. And that blur on the window
isn’t imagination—<i>it’s oil</i>!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>“A cracked cylinder!” was Fred Marmon’s verdict,
the minute he saw the oil spray on the window.
“How near are we to landing, navigator?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Less than an hour,” Lieutenant Levitt answered,
“provided there’s enough ceiling under those
clouds.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think there will be,” Captain O’Grady told
them. “See! There’s a break in the overcast, dead
ahead. We’ll go downstairs for a look.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Taking over the controls, he nosed the <i>Rosy</i> downward
through the black hole in the clouds. A moment
later Barry could see moonlight glinting on
the wave crests.</p>

<p class='c014'>At a thousand feet the Fortress leveled out. Above
her the cloud scuff was breaking up rapidly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Got that radio damage located yet, Babbitt?”
O’Grady asked through the interphone. “We really
ought to let Trinidad know that we’re on our way
in, so they won’t be throwing up a lot of flak at us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll have the trouble fixed in about five minutes,
sir,” Soapy replied. “Good thing we have plenty of
spare parts. What that freak lightning bolt did to us
was a caution!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>Just ahead a dark land mass rose out of the sea.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s the upper jaw of the ‘Dragon’s Mouth,’”
O’Grady remarked. “Trinidad is just beyond. I’m
going upstairs again, until Soapy gets our radio working.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The big bomber nosed sharply upward. For a few
moments she clawed her way in almost pitch darkness
through a cloud. Then the moonlight shone
clear through the windows.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly a shaft of brilliant light burst through
a rent in the scuff below them. Other searchlights
stabbed upward. A sharp detonation jarred the Fortress.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Antiaircraft shell!” grunted <i>Rosy’s</i> Old Man.
“Evidently they don’t like unidentified planes cruising
over the airfield. We’d better spin off.”</p>

<p class='c014'>WHAMM! BLAMM!</p>

<p class='c014'>Two shells, still closer than the first, made the big
plane rock. Tex O’Grady pulled the stick back between
his knees and gave the engine full throttle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Guess those hombres mean business, Blake,” he
chuckled. “How do you like being under fire for the
first time?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know,” replied Barry with a forced grin.
“Somehow it doesn’t seem quite real, being shot at
by your own ground forces. The trouble is that those
shells would hurt just as much as Jap flak.”</p>

<div id='fig03'  class='figcenter id007'>

<p><i>“Radio’s Okay, Sir!” Came Soapy Babbitt’s Voice</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>“Radio’s okay, sir!” came Soapy Babbitt’s voice.
“What’ll I send?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Identification signals first,” the Old Man replied.
“Explain what happened to our radio and lights.
Then tell ’em to switch on the floodlights, so we can
land before the oil from that cracked engine cylinder
drowns us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Soapy was still talking into his radio when the
searchlights behind them switched off. O’Grady nosed
down. In a moment floodlights lighted up the field
a few miles distant. The <i>Rosy</i> landed lightly for all
her massiveness, and braked to a smooth stop.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Yahoo!</i> Me for some hot coffee!” whooped her
Old Man, reaching for the entrance hatch. “Last
man to the office buys for the whole bunch!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Six days were spent in Trinidad, replacing the
cracked cylinder and repairing the lightning’s damage
to the electrical system. On the seventh day
<i>Rosy</i> hopped off on her long trip across the Atlantic
to Freetown, Africa.</p>

<p class='c014'>This time she carried a few bombs. It was Sergeant
Hale’s hope that they might sight a Nazi U-boat
on the crossing. The chance, of course, was one in a
million. However, watching for a target would help
to dispel the monotony of the trip.</p>

<p class='c014'>The weather was perfect—not a single bump in the
air. With “George,” the automatic gyro, taking care
of their flying, the pilots had little to do. By turns,
they napped, lunched, listened to the radio, played
games with the others of the crew. Even Fred Marmon
had a soft snap, for <i>Rosy’s</i> hungry “quadruplets”
were sucking their gas without a whimper.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>Only Sergeant Hale, the bombardier, refused to
join his crewmates in killing time. Stretched at full
length in the plane’s transparent nose, he stared
fixedly at the sea.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Danny is a born hunter,” the Old Man observed.
“Reckon he learned his patience from the Texas
Apaches. They’ll lie ten hours in one spot without
moving, waiting for a deer to pass a runway.”</p>

<p class='c014'>They were just six hours out from Trinidad when
Hale gave a bellow of discovery. Gazing down and
ahead, Barry saw a convoy of twenty merchant ships,
escorted by two destroyers and three corvettes. The
intensified Nazi submarine attacks had made heavy
protection necessary, he reasoned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll go down and say hello to them,” said the
captain, fastening his safety belt. “Maybe it will
cheer them up to see <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> dropping
them a curtsy, even if she can’t stick around.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With engines throttled down, the bomber dropped
toward the crawling convoy. Fascinated, Barry Blake
watched the toy-like ships grow larger. Now he could
make out the British flags and the tiny figures of the
antiaircraft gun crews in their tin nests on the superstructures.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope no cockeyed gunner takes us for an enemy
and cuts loose,” he thought. “That wouldn’t be any
fun at all—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Submarines to the right!</i>” yelled Sergeant Danny
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>Hale. “I can see their shadows just under the surface,
Captain. And look—they’ve just fired two torpedoes!
Let’s smash ’em!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You bet your sweet neck we will!” answered the
Old Man. “Take over the throttles, Blake. Watch
your r.p.m. We’ll give Hale a target he can’t miss....
Sergeant Babbitt, signal the convoy that we’re
not bombing <i>them</i>!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Fortress leveled out at 500 feet. Glancing
down, Barry saw the deck of a freighter immediately
beneath him. He could almost catch the expressions
on the upturned faces of her crew. His eyes came
back to his instruments and clung to them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bombs away!” yelled Hale’s voice in the interphone.
“Give me a run at the other one, Captain.”</p>

<p class='c014'>WHOOM! BR-ROOM!</p>

<p class='c014'>As the Fortress zoomed sharply, the two bomb explosions
buffeted her. She staggered, gained altitude,
banked, and turned.</p>

<p class='c014'>WHAMM! A torpedo had struck. Flame blossomed
from the sides of the freighter. Another ship
was dodging the second “tin fish.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Searching the water for the submarines’ shadows,
Barry spotted one, but it looked misshapen, seen
through the spreading ring of the bomb burst. Then
he found the other. It was less distinct, evidently
diving at top speed. That was the next target.</p>

<p class='c014'>Between it and the convoy, a destroyer was circling
like an excited hound. She was waiting, Barry realized,
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>for <i>Rosy’s</i> next run. The corvettes were threading
their way through the mass of slower freighters,
to be in at the kill.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Steady, Blake—here we go again!” warned Captain
O’Grady. “If that Hun is too deep for our
bombs to hurt him, the explosion will spot his dive
for the destroyer. Her depth charges will get him
for sure.”</p>

<p class='c014'>WHR-R-ROOM! BOOM!</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>Rosy’s</i> second run was still lower. The explosions
made her aluminum skin crackle like an empty
oil can. Suddenly Barry glimpsed the mast of a
freighter spearing up at the bomber’s nose. He gave
her full throttle. The mast flashed beneath—seemingly
with mere inches of clearance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Upstairs” again, the fortress’s crew had a grandstand
view of the submarine’s finish. The destroyer
raced toward the mark left by <i>Rosy’s</i> last bombs. She
dumped a depth charge off her stem. Her Y-guns
pitched two more “ash cans,” bracketing the spot. A
fourth and last depth charge completed the square.</p>

<p class='c014'>Behind her, the corvettes darted to the oil slick
that now spread over Sergeant Hale’s first target, and
dropped two more charges for good measure.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pilot from radioman,” Soapy Babbitt’s voice
crackled on the interphone. “The destroyer’s commander
sends us his congratulations and thanks. He
thinks we bagged the second sub, too. Wishes we
could stay with him for the rest of the voyage.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>“I reckon he’s telling the truth,” chuckled <i>Rosy’s</i>
Old Man. “Those undersea wolves have been hanging
right at the heels of every convoy lately. They
hunt in packs. We’ll just swing around the outskirts
of this floating freight train and see if Danny Hale
can spot any more suspicious shadows.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Fortress banked slightly in a slow turn, describing
a twenty-mile circle around the convoy. As
she swung back again, Barry could see the result of
one torpedo hit.</p>

<p class='c014'>The freighter had been struck on the starboard
side near the bow. She was slightly down by the
head. Smoke was still rising from her forecastle, but
she still kept her place in line. Her life-boats were
in place, with nobody near them. Evidently her crew
had no other thought than to take her to port.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s the second oil slick, Captain!” Hale
called. “We got both those U-boats. Yip-yip-yippee!”</p>

<p class='c014'>As the bombardier’s coyote howl shrilled in his
earphones, Barry Blake laughed outright. Like every
man on board he felt pretty cocky. Already their ship
had been under fire. Now she had drawn first blood,
sinking at least one enemy submarine without help.
The world was their oyster, waiting to be cracked
wide open when they reached the battlefront.</p>

<p class='c014'>With a final waggle of their broad wings, <i>Sweet
Rosy O’Grady</i> turned her back on the convoy and
headed eastward on her course. A chorus of grateful
whistles followed her. Owing to the thunder of her
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>own engines, her crew could not hear the freighter’s
salutes, but Tony Romani in the tail turret reported
seeing the puffs of white steam.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sinking of the subs provided conversation to
last Barry and his companions for most of the trip.
They were still comparing notes when the sun set.
That put an end to Sergeant Hale’s sea-gazing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Supper was supplied from thermos jugs and a box
of sandwiches. Afterwards, Curly Levitt took a fix
from the stars, and made a slight correction in their
compass course. The engines were behaving so beautifully
that their red-headed nurse, Fred, began to be
bored. He roamed from tail turret to cockpit playing
small practical jokes on everyone, until the Old
Man told him to spin off.</p>

<p class='c014'>By midnight everyone but Captain O’Grady was
dozing. His co-pilot was sound asleep in his seat.
He was waked by the first red beams of the sun rising
over Africa. That was another thrill for Barry Blake—watching
the shoreline of a foreign continent loom
up out of the horizon. He slapped on his earphones
in time to hear Curly Levitt giving the Old Man another
change of course—this time to the north.</p>

<p class='c014'>A few minutes later the deep harbor of Freetown
took shape beneath them. Soapy Babbitt, contacting
the RAF field, received permission to come in and
land. The first of their long, transoceanic hops was
safely ended.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

    <div>RAID ON RABAUL</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The stop at Freetown was brief—chiefly for gas and
a bit of rest for <i>Rosy’s</i> crew. Shortly after noon the
big bomber took off again, headed for Accra, six
hundred miles to the eastward. There the Pan
American Lines had everything to do a complete
servicing job. Captain O’Grady landed his ship just
before the sudden equatorial night shut down.</p>

<p class='c014'>A two-day rest put <i>Rosy</i> in first-class shape. Her
engines were thoroughly broken in. Her mighty
framework had been tested in action. Now it remained
for her guns and gun turrets to be tried out
under combat conditions.</p>

<p class='c014'>And her crew! As Captain Tex O’Grady glanced
at their keen, confident young faces, he knew he
could depend on them. They’d meet danger with a
grin of defiance and their cool efficiency would whittle
down any odds they might meet.</p>

<p class='c014'>Six thousand miles still remained between them
and the Indian battlefront to which they had been
ordered. The route would lie across Nigeria to Lake
Tchad, then northwest to the Egyptian Sudan and
down the Nile to Cairo. From there they would fly
eastward in easy hops over Iran and India, till they
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>reached their assigned base.</p>

<p class='c014'>That was the plan; but in wartime the plans of
mice and men are especially subject to change. A
few hours before his take-off from Accra, radioed
orders reached Captain O’Grady to head for Australia
and the South Pacific. Heavy bombers were more
urgently needed there, it appeared. And that meant
<i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i>!</p>

<p class='c014'>The new orders involved a greatly changed route.
From now on Captain O’Grady and his crew would
be flying below the equator. Heading southeast, they
would have to cross the great Belgian Congo into
East Africa before stopping to refuel. As soon as
Fred Marmon learned that, he gave his “quadruplets”
an extra careful inspection. A forced landing in those
all but trackless jungles was something he hated to
contemplate.</p>

<p class='c014'>From Accra the Flying Fortress took off with all
gas tanks full. Nine hundred miles across the Gulf
of Guinea she roared to Libreville, where the Fighting
French made up her depleted fuel. In the air
again, she swept in a few hours over the vast territory
that took H. M. Stanley years to explore. Twice she
crossed the mighty Congo River. Then the five-hundred-mile
expanse of Lake Tanganyika lay below.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Watch out for elephants and giraffes, boys,” came
the Old Man’s humorous drawl. “This is the country
all the animal crackers come from. I’ll take <i>Rosy</i>
down low enough so that you can see them.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>There was a general laugh, but as Captain O’Grady
nosed his ship down to a thousand feet the crew
really started to look. Perhaps the Old Man wasn’t
kidding after all.</p>

<p class='c014'>The dense masses of green forest broke up into
small patches. Lush grazing lands appeared, with
here and there a clump of trees. Farther on stretched
a dry plain, spotted with the green of an occasional
water hole. As they neared one of these, Barry Blake
gave a shout.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There are your elephants, Captain!” he exclaimed.
“We interrupted their drink. I see a bunch
of ostriches on the run, too—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ostriches—ha, ha!” Tex O’Grady chuckled.
“We’re not that near to Australia, Bub. Those long-necked
critters you see are <i>giraffes</i>. Want me to prove
it to you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He shoved the stick forward. As the giant plane
dipped down to within two hundred feet of them, the
frightened giraffes scattered like sheep. Barry could
see their long, pathetic necks swaying like masts as
they turned this way or that. Seconds later the herd
was far behind.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When we reach Australia, Lieutenant,” Curly
Levitt’s voice murmured in the headphones, “I’ll
buy you a beautiful, big picture book, and you can
learn that G stands for Giraffe, and E for Elephant
and M for the little Monkey who didn’t know which
was which.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>A howl of merriment from the others who were
listening in made Barry’s ears tingle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Okay, okay, I asked for it!” he admitted ruefully;
and for the next hour he felt like a high school kid
who has pulled the prize “boner” of the week in
class.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sensation wasn’t comfortable. Yet it went
farther than anything that had happened yet to make
him feel at one with the other members of the crew.
These men, he realized, weren’t simply a detachment
of non-coms and officers. They were a team, a family,
an organism knit together by closer bonds than their
assigned duties. Every last one of them was a brother
to the rest, regardless of race or rank.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was dark when the Flying Fortress reached Dar-es-Salam
on the east coast. The next day, after servicing,
the <i>Rosy O’Grady</i> hopped off across the Mozambique
Channel. That same afternoon she landed at
Tananarivo, Madagascar’s mountain capital, where
the Fighting French had recently improved the landing
field to take care of heavy planes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is the last land we’ll see for three thousand-odd
miles,” O’Grady informed his crew. “Next stop
will be Broome, Australia. Marmon and Jackson, you
will make an especially close check on the engines.
Take your time about it. Better to spend an extra
day here than a month on rubber rafts somewhere in
the Indian Ocean.”</p>

<p class='c014'>By noon of the third day, Fred and Cracker had
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>checked and re-checked everything. Some of the care
they took was really unnecessary. When they had
finished, however, the bomber’s power plant was as
perfect as human skill could make it. The fuel tanks
were full. Food and water for a thirty-hour trip were
aboard, but no bombs. To allow a safe margin in
case of bad weather, the ship must fly as light as possible
and save her gas.</p>

<p class='c014'>They took off just at dawn. Soon they were out of
sight of land, and from then on the trip became a
long fight against boredom. Half of the way they
flew on two engines, to economize on gas. The big
bomber loafed along at five thousand feet, except on
two occasions when she sighted squalls and had to
dodge them. Before the trip was ended most of the
<i>Rosy’s</i> crew would have welcomed a storm to break
the monotony.</p>

<p class='c014'>They landed at Broome, on Australia’s southwest
tip, with plenty of gas to spare. The next day they
headed northeastward, across the continent. Stopping
at an American base in northern Queensland,
they gassed up and hopped off on the last leg of their
long flight to the battle zone.</p>

<p class='c014'>Their base, when they found it, was still being
carved out of the New Guinea jungle with the help
of native labor. On the dirt runway Old Man
O’Grady set his ship down like a cat on velvet. The
moment she stopped he let out an old-time “rebel”
yell.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>When Barry and Fred Marmon climbed out last,
after making their final checks, the <i>Rosy’s</i> red-haired
engineer looked scornfully around him. In mock disgust,
he stared at a group of men filling in a big, raw
hole with shovels.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look, Lieutenant!” he snorted. “This is what
we came three quarters of the way around the globe
to find—a potato patch in the back woods!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes?” retorted Barry with a grim smile. “Those
boys aren’t planting spuds, Fred; they’re filling in a
new shell hole. The Japs must have dropped a few
of Tojo’s calling cards just a little before we landed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Japs called again that night. This time the
“cards” that they dropped were shells from a cruiser
that had sneaked close to the shore, in the dark hours.
Five miles away, she let loose with her heaviest guns.
Her aim was surprisingly accurate. To the <i>Rosy
O’Grady’s</i> crew, the stuff seemed to be exploding all
around their tent.</p>

<p class='c014'>The screaming of shells, each followed instantly
by an earth-shaking blast, produced a nightmare of
horror for the unseasoned men. Not one of them
gave way to fear, however. The most upset man in
the tent was Tex O’Grady, who paced up and down
between the cots, worrying about his ship and fighting
mosquitoes. He couldn’t get <i>Rosy</i> into the air,
because the field had no lights as yet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If I knew this confounded field better,” he
fumed, “I’d take off and get her safe upstairs. But
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>except for those shell flashes it’s as dark as the inside
of a cow. I’d only ground loop—”</p>

<p class='c014'>WHANG!</p>

<p class='c014'>A shell burst, nearer than any before it; tossed
chunks of earth through the open flap. Some dirt
must have struck O’Grady in the mouth, Barry
guessed, from the way the Old Man sputtered and
spat.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Better get your head down, Captain,” Curly
Levitt spoke up. “You’re not as big a target as <i>Rosy</i>,
but you’ll be safer on your cot.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The shelling stopped as suddenly as it had started.
Later Barry learned that a pair of motor torpedo
boats had routed the Jap cruiser, with two gaping
holes below her waterline.</p>

<p class='c014'>The damage to ships on the flying field was comparatively
light. One bomber had received a direct
hit. Three more were damaged by shell fragments.
<i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> had escaped without a scratch.
The worst tragedy was the killing of a twin-engined
bomber’s crew when a shell exploded in their tent.
Seven men had been sleeping there. All that was
found of them was buried the next day in a single
grave.</p>

<p class='c014'>The attack was the last thing needed to make
Barry and his friends ready for a raid of their own.
Every man in the field was fighting mad. When
O’Grady brought them the news that they were
scheduled for a bombing mission that day, the <i>Rosy’s</i>
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>crew cheered like maniacs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’re going with the squadron to lay eggs on
Rabaul,” the Old Man told them. “High-altitude
stuff. You gunners will probably get your chance at
a few Zero fighters, so make sure you load up with
ammunition before we leave. Here come the carts
to bomb us up now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Before <i>Rosy</i> had taken her last five-hundred
pound egg on board the squadron commander was
racing his Fortress down the runway. The other
ten followed. Last of all, Old Man O’Grady took
his ship up to her assigned position at the end of
the right wing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Looking ahead, Barry Blake thrilled at the sight
of the other mighty Fortresses flying in a perfect V
of V’s. To his mind they spelled irresistible, smashing
power—force which must, in the long run, blast
all the little yellow invaders out of the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the 600-mile distance to Rabaul narrowed, a
tense expectancy gripped pilots and gunners. The
squadron was flying at high bombing altitude, 25,000
feet. Every man was in his place, for at any time now
a swarm of enemy planes might appear.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Japs were struggling grimly to keep their grip
on New Britain, Barry knew. Many of their best
fighter squadrons had been shifted there from other
fronts, in the past few weeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sixty miles still to go!” Curly Levitt’s warning
came over the interphone.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>O’Grady turned his head to glance at his co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Nips’ aircraft detectors have heard us by
now,” he drawled. “They’re manning their guns,
and sweating some, too, I reckon. A bunch of Zero
fighters will be taking off to bother us on the way
in.... How do you feel about it, Blake?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“As if I’d like a gun in my hands—or the lever that
releases the bombs,” Barry laughed. “I feel just a little
useless.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Tex O’Grady’s smile faded out. He gazed straight
ahead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You won’t be useless if anything happens to me,
son,” he replied, gravely. “Keep your eyes peeled on
every side now.... Those Zeros <i>may</i> not show up
until after we’ve made our run, but you never can
tell.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Sergeant Hale in the bomber’s nose began counting
aloud through the interphone.</p>

<p class='c014'>“—thirteen—fourteen—fifteen Zeros dead ahead,
and a flight of three more just above them. Here
they come!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Flights two, three and four, pull in closer!”
barked the command radio. “Wing men will step up—the
others down—ready to repel attacking planes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Glancing up and to the right, Barry caught sight
of still another enemy flight arrowing down at the
Fortresses. He nudged O’Grady and pointed with
his finger. The Old Man merely nodded. Keeping
<i>Rosy</i> in her place in the tight protective formation
was his only task for the moment.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>BR-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R!</p>

<p class='c014'>With a chattering roar that cut through the engines’
thunder, <i>Rosy’s</i> nose, top turret, and side guns
went into action. From the squadron’s .50-caliber
machine guns burst a storm of white tracer bullets.
These mingled briefly with the fire of the diving enemy.
Then most of the Zeros were below the flying
forts.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i> belly turret opened up, followed
by Tony Romani’s fire from the “stinger” turret in
the tail. As it ceased, the thought came to Barry
Blake: “We’ve knocked them out of the sky! I
thought those Japs were tough fighters, but this was
like shooting clay pigeons. There’s nothing in sight
but three Zeros torching down below—”</p>

<p class='c014'>A slamming explosion jarred the fuselage. Then
the side gun manned by Curly Levitt chattered
harshly. Out of the corner of his eye, Barry saw the
nearest Fortress stagger out of place in the V.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pilot from top gunner!” Soapy Babbitt’s report
came through the phones. “Turret damaged by enemy
shells. Machine guns still fire, but can’t aim.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you hurt, Soapy?” the Old Man asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My left shoulder won’t work right,” came Babbitt’s
reply. “Nothing to worry about. I’ll keep
watch for more diving Zeros.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ready, Blake!” O’Grady spoke sharply. “Watch
your throttles—we’re nearing our targets now.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Barry glued his eyes to the r.p.m. indicator. He
forced his nerves to ignore the antiaircraft shells that
burst closer and closer. This was the big moment of
the whole raid—when the bombs were about to plummet
down.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cold air from the open bomb-bay doors rushed
into the big ship’s belly. There came the welcome
whistle of a falling bomb; then another, and another.
A moment afterward the harbor of Rabaul swept
beneath. It was out of sight before Barry could spot
the bomb hits.</p>

<p class='c014'>KRANG!</p>

<p class='c014'>An antiaircraft burst rocked the big bomber like
a cradle. Her right inboard engine sputtered and
quit. Looking out at the wing, Barry glimpsed a
jagged shrapnel hole in the cowling. He glanced to
the left. Another Fortress had been hit. She was
falling out of formation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never mind, boys, <i>Rosy O’Grady</i> can toddle home
all right on three engines,” the Old Man declared.
“All you’ve got to do is to smack down every Zero
you see....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here come three of ’em, straight down at us!”
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>yelped Soapy Babbitt from the jammed top turret.
“If only I could aim these guns!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Maybe a Jap will cross your sights, Soapy!” the
Old Man grunted, as he reefed back on the wheel.
“I’ll try to give Hale a shot.”</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rosy’s</i> nose came up. Her forward guns cut loose
at the trio of diving planes. One spun away, smoking;
another changed direction. The third kept coming,
with his tracer bullets feeling for the Flying
Fortress. When they touched her the Jap pilot pulled
the trigger of his cannon.</p>

<p class='c014'>A stunning blast threw Barry hard against his safety
belt. Something—it felt like a hard-thrown baseball—struck
his head. He felt himself falling into a black
void.</p>

<p class='c014'>Someone was shaking him, none too gently. A
voice, Curly Levitt’s, pierced through his dulled consciousness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wake up, Barry! Wake up and take over these
controls before I have to,” the navigator was repeating
in his ear. “The Old Man is out cold—ripped by
that shell.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry made a desperate effort. It was like struggling
against gravity, but he won. His eyes cleared.
The plane was flying on a fairly level keel, thanks to
Curly’s hand on the wheel, but something was very
wrong. The Old Man....</p>

<p class='c014'>One look at O’Grady’s crumpled form drove the
last of the fog out of Barry’s head. The captain’s left
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>arm was missing below the elbow. A handkerchief
tourniquet had stopped the worst bleeding, but there
were other wounds on his left side and leg. He was
mercifully unconscious.</p>

<p class='c014'>The bomber’s machine guns were still firing, by
fits and starts, but only two engines were still functioning.
The other Fortresses were nowhere in sight.
Two Zero fighters were coming head-on into Sergeant
Hale’s fire....</p>

<p class='c014'>These impressions took barely three seconds for
Barry to absorb. He gripped the wheel hard, setting
his teeth against the pain in his head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thanks, Curly,” he gritted. “You tend to the
Old Man.... With two good engines even a dumb
co-pilot ought to get <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> home
okay.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good man!” Curly exclaimed, as he turned to the
captain. “I’ll fix up your scalp wound later. Just fly
southwest until I get a chance to figure our exact position.”</p>

<p class='c014'>One of the Zeros that had been heading for <i>Rosy’s</i>
nose was now falling, with a trail of black smoke.
The other had swooped past. Barry heard one of the
side guns firing, then a burst from the belly turret.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Got him!” came Cracker Jackson’s grunt in the
radiophones.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry eased back on the wheel and found that his
crippled Fortress could still gain a little altitude.
Cold air still poured in from the open bomb doors;
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>a chunk of flak must have damaged the jacks that
raised them. Barry began calling the turrets one by
one to learn of any further damage.</p>

<p class='c014'>Aside from a shell hole through the rudder and
countless bullet holes, there was none worth mentioning.
Best of all, the sky seemed to be clear of
enemy fighters.</p>

<p class='c014'>The pain in Barry’s head was easier. His brain
functioned more clearly with each minute that
passed. From the crew’s reports he made a rough
calculation of the Jap planes shot down.</p>

<p class='c014'>About thirty fighters had attacked the bomber formation
as they approached Rabaul. Thirteen Zeros
had been shot down at the cost of one Fortress. The
eleven remaining bombers had laid their eggs with
perfect accuracy on the docks and ships, and flown
on. The Zeros, already decimated, had hung around
just out of range. When <i>Rosy</i> fell behind, with one
engine damaged by antiaircraft fire, the Japs had
jumped on her like wolves.</p>

<p class='c014'>Seventeen Zero fighters against one crippled Boeing—and
the Fortress had won out! Nine of the Japs
had torched down. The others had turned back to
their home base.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry’s heart swelled with pride in the great ship
and the fighting crew of which he was a member.
Except for that last shell hit....</p>

<p class='c014'>A glance at the slumped figure of Tex O’Grady
sobered him. Curly Levitt had finished bandaging
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>the captain, and Fred Marmon was helping to lift
him out of his seat. The two men lugged their
wounded pilot back toward the tail and laid him
down, wrapped in their coats.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What are the Old Man’s chances?” the young co-pilot
asked, as the navigator returned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s hard to tell how deep those shell fragments
in his side have gone,” Curly answered. “He’s lost
a lot of blood, too. All we can do now is hope....
Hold steady, now, while I swab out that cut in your
scalp—oh-oh! I can feel something there.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“So can I!” grunted Barry. “Take it easy, fella!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Curly’s fingers touched the cut again, cautiously.
Barry felt a stabbing twinge.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There it is, Mister!” the navigator shouted. “A
bit of shrapnel as big as my thumbnail. If your head
weren’t solid bone, as I’ve always suspected, we’d be
minus a co-pilot.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He held the scrap of jagged metal in front of Barry’s
nose for a second, then stuck it in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When you tie it up, be sure to leave the bone in,”
Barry answered with a grin. “When this war is over
you can get yourself a nice job in a butcher shop. It
would just suit your rough-and-ready style.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s base ingratitude!” Curly retorted, applying
the bandage. “I hope Soapy Babbitt is more
appreciative when I fix him up. He got a smashed
shoulder when the top turret was wrecked.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As Curly left him, the full weight of his responsibility
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>settled upon Barry’s mind. Had the Old Man
been at the controls, <i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i> crippled condition
would not have worried him particularly. If it
were possible to bring a ship home on only one engine,
Barry would have trusted his captain to do it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, however, both the wounded plane and her
wounded crew depended on him. With little more
than training school experience, could he land them
safely? As he struggled against such fears, Fred Marmon’s
voice sounded in his ears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve got bad news for you, Lieutenant,” the engineer
announced. “The same burst of flak that
jammed the bomb doors washed out the electrical
system. Your landing flaps won’t work and your
wheels won’t come down. Looks like we’ll all have
to bail out and let <i>Rosy</i> crash.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry’s first feeling was one of relief. Now, at
least, he wouldn’t have to risk the lives of everybody
aboard, landing a shot-up plane on a jungle field.
But, wait! How about Old Man O’Grady? Even
if somebody pulled the chute’s cord for him and
dumped him out, the landing would kill him. A
parachute lets you down with about the same shock
you’d feel if you jumped out of a second story window.
A half-dead man could never survive it, even
if he didn’t land in the jungle and break his back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You men will bail out,” Barry said into the intercom
mike. “When we get near the field, strap Captain
O’Grady into his own seat, and pad him with
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>your coats against the shock of a crackup. I’ll try to
land <i>Rosy</i> on her belly without too much of a flop.
It’s the Old Man’s only chance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The crew got that reasoning without any trouble.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It makes me feel like a doggone coyote!” big
Danny Hale muttered, turning to look at Barry. “My
great gran’daddy didn’t leave the old Alamo, when it
was <i>sure</i> death to stay. I reckon if he was in my
place—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He’d obey orders, just as you’re going to do,
Danny,” Barry Blake shot back at him. “I’m in command
of this plane, while the Old Man is out. You
and every other member of the crew will bail out
when we reach the field. That’s final!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I agree absolutely, except on one point,” Curly’s
voice chimed in. “You’re wounded, Lieutenant. It’s
a miracle that you can fly a ship at all, with the beating
you’ve had. It’s no reflection on your skill—or
your grit—to say that you might go dizzy at the last
minute of landing, and crack up. Now, I’ve had
some flight training, enough to land belly-floppers
on a soft field. Therefore it’s <i>my</i> place and not
yours—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Spoken like a lawyer, Curly!” laughed the young
co-pilot. “You’re a swell guy to offer, but it’s no go.
So don’t argue. Just tell me when we’re nearing our
base, and then help Fred bring the Old Man back to
the cockpit.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a little more discussion of the landing
Barry would have to attempt, but nobody else protested.
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>As soon as Soapy Babbitt was made as comfortable
as he could be, the thermos jug of coffee was
passed around. Barry forced himself to eat a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>After a seemingly endless time Curly Levitt reported
that he had warned the base by radio. The
field would soon be in sight.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the distance Barry recognized the New Guinea
coastline. Now he picked out certain mountain landmarks
that gave him the exact direction of the base.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bring the Old Man up front, fellows,” he said.
“And then hook on your parachutes. We have about
five minutes to go.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The men worked fast. Captain O’Grady was still
unconscious under the double effect of shock and
the morphine that Curly had administered. The
navigator and Fred Marmon handled him as tenderly
as they could. The strapping was finished, and the
men were back at the open bomb bay when Barry
spotted the field. Big Danny Hale was gripping the
zippered case that held his precious bomb-sight.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry tried to judge the proper moment for the
first parachute jump. Twisting in the seat, he raised
his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fred Marmon saluted, grinned, and dived headfirst
into space. The others followed in quick succession.
The bomber roared on, slowly circling the
field. Far below, Barry counted six white ’chutes
drifting toward the raw, brown slash in the jungle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They’re safe!” he murmured. “Wish I had a parachute
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>for <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i>, too!”</p>

<p class='c014'>When the last ’chutist had landed, the young pilot
nosed down and came in up-wind for his risky attempt.
He cut the gun, fishtailed to kill speed. A
Fortress’s wheels should touch the ground at ninety
miles an hour, for a smooth landing; but <i>Rosy</i>
couldn’t let down her wheels. A belly landing at
ninety would be an ugly mess.</p>

<p class='c014'>At a shaky sixty m.p.h. Barry brought her in. At
the last moment he let her drop. The bomb-bay
doors dug into the runway, before they ripped loose.
The ship bounced on her belly turret, tore an engine
clean out of its mounting, and came to rest.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the crash squad entered the cockpit, <i>Rosy’s</i>
young co-pilot was “out cold.” Fortunately neither
he nor the Old Man had received any further hurts.
A hospital-corps man jabbed a hypodermic into Barry’s
arm. Sixty seconds later, both he and Captain
O’Grady were being rushed on stretchers to the field’s
temporary dressing station.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next afternoon, Barry Blake woke up, feeling
almost himself again. The marvelous new Army
drugs had given him twenty-four hours of refreshing
sleep. His head wound had been expertly cleansed,
sewed and bandaged. His greatest discomfort was a
gnawing appetite. He swung his legs over the edge
of his cot and looked around for his clothes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hold it down, Lieutenant!” the medical-corps
man in charge warned him. “You’re scheduled to
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>stay right in this hangar till tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Quit woofing me, Corporal,” Barry growled. “I
feel fine. And I’m so hungry my belt buckle is bumping
my backbone. Did the major order you to starve
me, too?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, sir,” chuckled the medical man. “I’ll bring
you some chow right away. It’s almost time for mess
call so the cook will have it ready.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait a second!” Barry exclaimed, as the other
turned to go. “Where’s Captain O’Grady, and Sergeant
Babbitt? They ought to be here—”</p>

<p class='c014'>The corporal paused in the doorway, shaking his
head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not here, Lieutenant,” he replied. “This place
is only equipped as a field dressing station as yet.
Captain O’Grady and Sergeant Babbitt were flown
to Australia last night. The Captain will have a
fighting chance in a real hospital, and they’ll probably
save Babbitt’s arm, too.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry lifted his legs back onto his bunk and relaxed.
So the field doctor had given Tex O’Grady a
fighting chance! That was better news than any of
<i>Rosy’s</i> crew had expected.</p>

<p class='c014'>The medical-corps man returned with hot chow
and five grinning Fortress crewmen. Fred Marmon
was the first to grip Barry’s hand. Curly Levitt
crowded him aside, as Danny Hale and Tony Romani
and Cracker Jackson surrounded the cot. Everybody
was talking at once. Out of the barrage of wisecracks,
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>congratulations and laughter, Barry Blake got one
definite impression: his crew was immensely proud
of him, for making that landing and saving the life
of their Old Man.</p>

<p class='c014'>The medical corporal found difficulty in drawing
Barry’s attention back to his hot chow. He succeeded
at last, but <i>Rosy’s</i> young co-pilot was still too busy
talking to know what he was eating. The six friends
would have discussed the raid, the fight, and the return
trip for hours, if mess call had not interrupted.</p>

<p class='c014'>After supper, Curly Levitt returned to the dressing
station. The others, he said, were needed to help set
up the new equipment which had arrived during the
past two days. There were electrical generators,
searchlights, floodlights, antiaircraft guns, and the
first units of a big repair shop. This last would take
care of damaged planes landing on the field. It would
have crews to bring in ships that had crashed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When the repair plant is running, it will probably
be able to rebuild <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i>,” her
navigator stated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wish we could hope as much for her Old Man,”
Barry sighed. “But there’s no repair shop in the
world that can put a missing arm back on a pilot.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It will just about break his heart,” Curly agreed,
rising to his feet. “I imagine that Mrs. O’Grady
won’t feel too badly about having her husband back,
however.... Well, here’s the doctor, come to have
a look at you. That’s my signal to take off.”</p>

    <div>NIGHT ATTACK</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When Barry next saw Curly Levitt, the dapper
navigator was firing a sub-machine gun at the searchlighted
sky. Black parachutes were dropping toward
the field, with Jap soldiers dangling beneath them.
Every man on the field who could find a gun of any
kind was shooting at the rain of enemies. And the
Japs were firing back.</p>

<p class='c014'>The party started with a terrific bomb barrage
about midnight. The Japs evidently believed that
neither aircraft detectors nor antiaircraft equipment
were as yet set up. They were wrong about both.
Another thing they didn’t know was that most of the
living quarters, supplies, and even planes, had been
moved into the jungle that fringed the field.</p>

<p class='c014'>A few moments after the bombs started falling, the
new antiaircraft batteries went into action. They
caught three of the Jap bombers with their shells. In
return, bombs wiped out two guns, three searchlights,
and their crews. Then came the parachute
troops.</p>

<p class='c014'>There weren’t many of them—not more than fifty
in all. Apparently the fire was too intense for the
Jap transport planes to risk. Why these few suicide
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>squads were dropped remained a mystery until morning.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry reached the field as the first ’chutists landed.
He saw a Garand rifle in the hand of a soldier who
had been killed by shrapnel. The weapon, he found,
was fully loaded—and unharmed. As he turned to
pick a target, the field’s floodlights went on.</p>

<p class='c014'>A dozen of the Japs lay motionless, tangled in their
parachutes. The others were squirming free, or firing
from bombholes with their small caliber sub-machine
guns. Barry felt a bullet tug at his trouser leg;
another burned the skin of his shoulder. He threw
himself prone.</p>

<p class='c014'>A Jap had just wriggled free of his chute and was
diving toward a bomb crater. Barry took a snap shot
at the man, and saw him collapse. He switched his
aim to a hole from which the pale flames of Jap machine
guns were licking like serpents’ tongues. They
were firing at the floodlights, which were rapidly going
out.</p>

<p class='c014'>The shadows deepened across the bomb-torn field.
Barry was sure that some of them were Japs crawling
toward the jungle. He fired at the nearest. Suddenly
he realized that he was trying to shoot an empty gun.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bullets were kicking up dirt too close for comfort.
Barry glanced about and spotted a convenient bomb
crater. It was strange that he hadn’t noticed it before.
Clutching his empty gun, he rolled into the hole.</p>

<p class='c014'>As he reached the bottom a steely hand seized him
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>by the throat. Instinctively his hand shot up, grasped
a muscular wrist. Moonlight glinted faintly on the
long knife in the hand that he had blocked.</p>

<p class='c014'>While he struggled with both hands to wrest the
weapon away, a rocket streaked up the sky. Directly
overhead the flare burst, flooding everything with
white light. Barry’s enemy gasped and dropped his
butcher knife. He was Fred Marmon.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lieutenant Blake!” the redhead yelped. “Thank
Heaven for that flare—I might have carved you for
a Jap.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You mean I might have broken your arm!” retorted
Barry. “Listen, Fred—if you’ve got an extra
gun or a clip of ammo, let’s have it. I think those
yellow snakes are heading this way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have something better,” Marmon replied. “A
sack of hand grenades. I got ’em when the Japs
started landing. Help yourself—”</p>

<p class='c014'>He broke off as Barry made a lightning lunge past
him with his empty rifle. A high-pitched scream rang
briefly. Barry had rammed his gun-muzzle like a
bayonet into the face of a crawling Jap who had
reached the edge of the hole.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another queer-shaped helmet appeared, and beside
it a machine-gun’s muzzle. Barry swung his gun-butt
at the weapon, knocking it aside. A split instant
later Fred struck with his knife. The second Jap
kicked convulsively.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I fixed him!” the redhead muttered. “See any
more, Lieutenant?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>Other flares were lighting the field. Barry spotted
a furtive movement in a crater thirty yards from the
jungle’s edge.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s a bunch that’s getting ready to break for
the bush, I think,” he said. “Give me a few of your
grenades.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Swell! We’ll both rush ’em,” Fred Marmon responded.
“Here’s the bag of pineapples.... Help
yourself, sir.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry stuffed his pockets hastily. He kept one
grenade in his hand, with his finger through the ring.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll go first,” he said shortly.</p>

<p class='c014'>Crouching low, he sprinted toward the Japs’ bomb
hole. Before he had quite reached throwing distance,
the raiders saw him and opened fire. A slug glanced
off his helmet. He took three more strides and flung
himself flat. Behind a ten-inch-high ridge of earth
he pulled the pin of his first grenade. Then, rising
on one elbow, he flung it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Five yards away he glimpsed Fred hurling another.
As the second grenade landed six Japs boiled
up out of the bomb crater. Two were still on the
edge when the grenades went off—Barry’s in the
hole; Fred’s just ahead of them.</p>

<p class='c014'>A cheer went up from the American riflemen and
machine gunners. A new storm of gunfire broke out,
aimed at three or four other bomb craters.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come on, Fred!” Barry yelled. “We’ll clean out
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>the rest of the snakeholes. The boys are shooting to
keep the Japs’ heads down for us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Right with you, sir!” came the sergeant’s shout.</p>

<p class='c014'>So furious was their friends’ fire that few Jap bullets
came near Barry and Fred. Crouched within
easy throw of the occupied craters, they flung their
deadly little missiles. Some of the enemy attempted
a dash for the bush, only to be cut down. Once a
grenade was tossed back. It exploded in the air dangerously
close to Barry. Later he found that a flying
fragment had cut his cheek.</p>

<p class='c014'>With their “pineapples” gone, the two Fortress
men trotted back to the trees.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why didn’t I bring another bag of ’em?” the red-headed
engineer wailed. “I just know there’s a few
more Japs playing possum out there on the field.
Only way to get ’em is to toss a grenade into every
hole you can find—”</p>

<p class='c014'>Just in front of them an antiaircraft battery went
into action. The white fingers of the searchlights
began combing the sky again. Between the gun reports,
Barry caught the scream of a falling bomb.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Down!</i>” he yelled, pulling Fred to the ground
beside him.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ground erupted near them. Half dazed by
the shock, the two friends started crawling. Dirt
rained down on their helmets. From farther up the
field came more bomb concussions.</p>

<p class='c014'>This time the bombardment was less intense, but
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>it lasted for half an hour. One Jap bomber followed
another at irregular intervals, flying at a very high
altitude. The light of a blasted and blazing gasoline
truck furnished a plain target, not to mention the
antiaircraft gun flames and the searchlights. Yet the
Japs were so high that more bombs fell in the jungle
than struck the field.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the raid was over, Barry Blake headed for
the dressing station. His injured head was pounding
like a bass drum. He longed to lie down and close
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no place for him in the hospital tent,
however. The medical officer was operating on men
wounded by bomb fragments—tying off severed
arteries, sewing up torn flesh, probing for shrapnel.
He was stripped to the waist, covered with sweat and
blood. The medical-corps men were equally busy.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry had no intention of getting in their way. He
found some aspirin for himself, swallowed two of the
pills, swabbed iodine on his cut cheek, and left. In
his crew’s shelter tent he found Curly and Fred
arguing about the raid. He sank down on a cot beside
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s something queer about those parachute
troops,” Curly declared. “The Japs didn’t drop
them just by accident. They had some very important
job which only suicide squads could do. If only
we knew what it was....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t worry, sir,” said the red-haired sergeant.
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>“They didn’t accomplish it. We’ve just searched the
field and found only four live Japs. They were all
wounded. Two of ’em opened fire on us and were
blotted out. Number Three played dead until one
of our boys tried to turn him over. Then he set off
a grenade that blew both of ’em to pieces. Number
Four struck with his teeth—just like a rattlesnake—and
bit a medical-corps man’s cheek. He’s the only
one that’s still alive.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wouldn’t be too sure that they didn’t accomplish
anything important,” said Curly Levitt. “A
few of them may still be loose in the jungle. I have
a hunch that we’ll hear from them yet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m inclined to agree with you, Curly,” Barry
Blake put in. “I’m not so much worried about the
few Jap parachutists that may have escaped to the
bush. To be sure, they could do plenty of damage.
But if immediate damage had been their purpose,
we’d have had two or three times as many to fight. I
have a hunch that this bombing and skirmishing on
the field was just a trick to cover up some other
maneuver.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You mean a Jap landing on the beach, sir?”
asked Fred Marmon. “That thought hopped into
my head, too—but it’s no good. Our boys have that
coastline guarded so well that wild pigs couldn’t get
through without raising an alarm. Their scouts
would have brought us warning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let’s try to get a little shuteye, then,” Curly Levitt
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>yawned. “We won’t help matters by worrying or
arguing all night. ’Sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>At dawn the field was roused by a third bombardment.
This time it was a shelling from medium-heavy
field guns. It plowed the already bombed runways
until the field looked like a map of the moon’s
craters. Two swift fighter planes tried to take off before
the last smooth strip of ground was blown up.
One of them ground-looped.</p>

<p class='c014'>The second, by clever dodging of bomb holes,
managed to take the air. Fifteen minutes later it
returned, riddled with bullet holes. The pilot nosed
over trying to land on the field’s least plowed end.
When they pulled him out of his wrecked fighter he
said that he had flown over the enemy positions at
less than five hundred feet and had a pretty good
look at them.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Japs were entrenched on a grassy ridge, about
1500 feet above the field and within easy range.
There were two or three hundred of them, with at
least twenty pieces of artillery camouflaged in
clumps of trees. Evidently they had been landed by
parachute from a swarm of huge transport planes,
under cover of the night attack on the air field.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You were right about the purpose of that raid,
Lieutenant Blake,” Fred Marmon admitted, as the
<i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i> crew moved their tent farther into
the jungle. “The Japs will make our field useless
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>as long as they hold that ridge. The problem is how
to clean them out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Better heads than ours are working on that right
now,” Barry told him. “We could bomb the Jap positions
with planes based at Port Moresby, for instance.
Or we could bring up troops and take the
ridge by assault. But neither job would be as easy
as it sounds. We’ll just have to wait for the brass-hats
to decide.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The American plan did not develop for forty-eight
hours. During that time a transport vessel arrived
with more antiaircraft and two companies of
soldiers. They were welcome additions to the
field’s strength, but they did not solve the problem
of the Japs’ shellfire.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the third day after the Japs’ first raid, the
field’s commandant called all his officers together.
These included the air as well as the ground forces.
Between the regular <i>whoomp</i> of bursting shells, the
colonel outlined his plan of attack.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tomorrow,” he stated bluntly, “we shall attack
the enemy position on Grassy Ridge. I should like
to have had artillery here to soften up our objective,
but we cannot wait for it to arrive. A surprise attack
must take its place. After dark the infantry will
move forward as far as possible. They will carry iron
rations, and ammunition for their weapons. The attack
will be at dawn.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How about supplies, in case the Japs aren’t
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>routed by the first assault?” an infantry captain
asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In that case, our engineers will open a jeep road
through the bush with bulldozers,” the commandant
replied. “They’ll start in the morning, and push
ahead to the steep hillside a mile and a half from
Grassy Ridge. From there on we’ll have to carry all
supplies by manpower, including mortars for close-in
bombardment.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How about us fliers, Colonel?” the commanding
officer of the Fortress squadron spoke up. “Do we
have to loaf while even the native blacks are doing
their bit? Can’t we fix up one runway while the
Japs are busy ducking our shells? My boys would
love a chance to smash those egg-heads with a few
five-hundred-pounders.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’ll probably have your chance, Captain,” the
commandant smiled. “Building a road to the Ridge
is the engineers’ first job; after that they’ll tackle the
field. Don’t let your crews get mixed up in the
ground fighting, or some ships may be short-handed
when you’re ready to take off.... I think that is all
for the time being, gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Curly Levitt linked an arm through Barry’s as
they left the commandant’s tent.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That warning about crews joining the scrap
doesn’t apply to us, does it?” he asked. “We’re short-handed
already—with the Old Man and Babbitt in
the hospital. Anyhow, the <i>Rosy O’Grady</i> won’t fly
for a long time after this battle is over. We’re free to
do just about what we please, aren’t we?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I get your point,” Barry answered with a grim
smile. “You’re suggesting that the six of us form a
sort of guerrilla squad and bag a few Japs on our
own. Not a bad idea at all—if our squadron commander
agrees. Let’s get him alone now and see
what he thinks about it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Captain Loomis was not yet thirty years old, and
next to flying a fighting ship he loved best a fight on
the ground. His sympathy was easy to enlist.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can’t give you boys official permission to join
the ground attack,” he told Barry and Curly, “but
I won’t confine you to the post. If you pick up some
rifles and grenades and wander off into the woods,
that’s your affair. And I certainly wish you good
hunting!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>“Thanks, Captain,” Barry replied as the two
turned to leave. “If we find a Samurai sword in the
bush, we’ll bring it back to you for a souvenir.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The two young lieutenants found the rest of the
<i>Rosy’s</i> crew at mess, and passed them the word to
rendezvous in their tent. When the six were all together,
Barry broached the plan.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s better than sitting around and swatting mosquitoes,”
he concluded. “And we know that the
fight for Grassy Ridge will be tough. Six extra men
might be quite a help.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You don’t have to sell us the idea, Lieutenant,”
Fred Marmon spoke up. “After two days of taking
Jap shellfire we’re all spoiling for a chance to dish it
out. I know where we can get some hand grenades
and side-arms tonight.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know where there’s a case of tommy-guns,” said
Tony Romani. “We can ‘requisition’ them, so to
speak, this afternoon. And plenty of ammo, of
course.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll collect a few tin hats,” added Cracker Jackson,
“and some iron rations and water canteens.
Reckon you-all didn’t think of them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Danny Hale rose to his feet and spread his big
fingers.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If I get near enough to one of those yellow
snakes,” he said slowly, “I’d like to match his jiu-jitsu
tricks with an Apache wrestling hold. Anyhow,
the six of us ought to have a pretty good time
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>before the party’s over.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Before supper the <i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i> crew had collected
a young arsenal in their sleeping tent. It included
bayonets and three sheath knives. Fred Marmon
had brought six suits of green coveralls to replace
their flying togs, and even some burnt cork to
blacken their faces.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll have to fit a tin hat over that nice, clean
bandage of yours, Lieutenant Blake,” he said. “Anything
white would draw Jap bullets like a doggone
magnet.... Look. If I set it on sidewise, like this, it
doesn’t hurt your wound.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s fine, Fred,” Barry agreed. “I’d be cooler
without the thing, but it <i>will</i> turn bullets. We’re all
going to have a lot more sympathy for the infantry
after this masquerade.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The attacking troops set out as soon as the tropic
night had shut down. Barry Blake and his friends
joined a platoon that was pushing and slashing its
way through the pitch-black jungle, with the help
of a few dimmed flashlights. The vine-laced growth
was so dense that at high noon only a green twilight
would have penetrated it. Bayonets and machetes
made openings through the worst tangles. Thorn
bushes fought back, raking arms and legs mercilessly.
Some of the advancing units used compasses to keep
them headed toward Grassy Ridge. A few of them
had the help of native guides. Most, however, followed
the trails opened by the advance guard.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>The <i>Rosy’s</i> crew took their turns with the machetes,
cutting a path. The work, in that hot-house
temperature, was exhausting. At any rate, the advancing
troops had plenty of time. They reached
the hill’s steep, rocky base at about midnight.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here the word was passed to rest for an hour.
Mosquito headnets were donned; emergency rations
were opened. Weary, and sweating at every pore, the
men stretched themselves out in such level spaces as
they could find by groping on the damp ground.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fred Marmon complained that the mosquitoes
liked his blood better than that of any man in the
Army. He declared that more of them were gathering
from all over New Guinea, as the news spread.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If they suck me to death,” he groaned, “dig a
hole and bury my carcass quick so it won’t draw any
more of them. Enough of these flying siphons could
wipe out the whole company.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Big Danny Hale also suffered aloud. He declared
that the only difference between New Guinea mosquitoes
and Zero fighting planes was that the bugs
didn’t need an airfield. In size and poison, he insisted,
they were about equal.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the end of the hour, word was passed to start
climbing the lower, wooded sides of the hill. This
was to be a far slower and more cautious task than
the first few hours of the advance. The Japs were
less than a mile above them now. Not even dimmed
flashlights would be permitted, except in the hands
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>of platoon leaders. All movements would be as slow
as a snail’s and, if possible, as silent.</p>

<p class='c014'>By touch, and by occasional low whispers, the men
kept in contact. There were frequent halts, to let
those behind catch up. Only the knowledge that
they were nearing the enemy, and would soon be
charging his positions, kept the soldiers’ nerves from
exploding.</p>

<p class='c014'>The last and hardest wait came at the edge of the
bush, where the coarse, four-foot-high grass began.
Scouts had been sent out to locate the Jap positions,
so the soldiers’ “grapevine” reported. When they
returned, the troops were to move forward. If all
went well they would pounce upon their enemies in
the first gray light of dawn. The Japs, notoriously
late sleepers when they did not expect an attack,
would be caught literally napping.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It sounds fine,” Curly Levitt muttered in Barry’s
ear. “But one little mistake of ours could give those
people warning. Wouldn’t it have been safer to surround
the Nips’ positions and rush them from all
sides?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Possibly—in full daylight,” Barry whispered
back. “But at dawn there’s danger of shooting down
our own troops by mistake. Our jungle uniforms
are enough like the Japs’ to fool you where the
visibility is low. You’ve given me an idea, though,
Curly. If the rest of our crew agree, we six might
circle around to the enemy’s rear. We’re not under
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>orders, and we’d be taking our own risk.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait a minute while I crawl around and ask
them,” the <i>Rosy’s</i> navigator replied eagerly. “I
think they’ll eat it up!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Curly was right in his guess. The extra risks involved
meant little to the four Air Force sergeants.
They would go where Barry Blake led, even if it
meant charging the whole Jap force with hand grenades.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fortunately for their plan, the six “guerillas” were
on the far right wing of the attacking line. In the
darkness their silent departure would not be noticed.
Keeping contact by touch alone, they crawled away
along the edge of the jungle.</p>

<p class='c014'>The moon was now well up in the sky, silvering
the long grass of the hill-crest. Thus Barry could
watch the lay of the land, while keeping in the black
shadow of the bush. On reaching the height of land,
he stopped.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s a rocky outcropping twenty yards from
here,” he whispered to Curly Levitt. “I’m going to
crawl out to it and try to spot the Jap gun positions....
They might give us a clue to the trenches
our scout plane reported the first day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Without waiting for Curly’s answer, Barry Blake
wormed his way toward the exposed outcrop. Reaching
it, he inched his way to the highest part. Now
he had no protection except the dirty color of his
jungle suit. If a Jap sentry should catch his least
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>movement, it would be just too bad.</p>

<p class='c014'>From the rocks he looked down on a sea of grass,
broken by little islands of brush and trees. No
trenches appeared. They were either cleverly camouflaged
with grass, or else there were none near by.
One of the tree clumps, however, drew Barry’s especial
interest. From where he lay, a vaguely pagoda-like
shape could be glimpsed protruding from the
shadows.</p>

<p class='c014'>A Jap tent, draped with camouflage netting? It
would be worth a risk to discover the truth, Barry
believed. Cautiously he crawled back to his friends.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll proceed in single file, on hands and knees,”
he told them. “Stick a lot of grass in your helmet
nets before you start. It’s nearly dawn now, so we
won’t have long to wait for the big fight to open.
Better take a good drink from your water canteens
while you have a chance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A foot at a time they advanced, with little pauses.
A sentry, had he glimpsed the movement of their
grass trimmed hats, might have taken it for a passing
breeze.</p>

<p class='c014'>The light grew stronger. The clump of trees took
more definite shape. Now the guerillas could see
clearly the angle of a large tent with its protective
netting. From within came snores in three or four
different keys.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Officers’ tent!” Curly whispered. “Sentry must
be asleep, too—if there is one. What’ll we do now?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>“Get a little nearer; wait for the first shot of the
main attack, and then toss a couple of grenades
apiece. That ought to put us into the scrap with a
bang.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Twelve bangs!” chuckled Curly. “Even one small
bomb would do a better job, though.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry moved off in a different direction, to bring
the open door of the tent into full view. Five yards
further on he stopped with a gasp. His hand had
slipped into a hole, beneath the grass roots.</p>

<p class='c014'>Laying down his tommy-gun, Barry grasped the
edge of the hole and lifted. A whole section of the
“ground” tilted up. Beneath it yawned black emptiness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here’s a trench!” he whispered over his shoulder
to Curly. “It’s covered with grass sods, laid on matting.
Tell the boys to come on in.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Feet first, he let himself down into the hole. It was
only four feet deep and very narrow. Evidently the
Japs had dug it as a protection against air attacks,
but it could also be used for ground fighting. For
the guerillas’ purpose it was ideal.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Barry’s orders, only three mats were removed—no
more than could be quickly replaced. In the
opening all six men stood, waiting for daylight and
the first gun. Each held a grenade, as he faced the
door of the Jap Officers’ tent.</p>

<div id='fig06'  class='figcenter id010'>

<p><i>“Here’s a Trench!” He Whispered Over His Shoulder</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>Their wait was not long, though to their tensed
nerves it seemed hours. From behind them a Jap
sentry’s rifle shot was blanketed by the heavier voices
of American sub-machine guns. Shrill yells arose.
The sharper clatter of Jap .25-caliber machine guns
joined the din.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry’s party needed no command to toss their
deadly little “pineapples.” Two apiece, they lobbed
them right into the tent. Then they ducked, pulling
the grass mats over them.</p>

<p class='c014'>The explosions came almost together—like a string
of giant firecrackers. A patter of debris sounded on
the grass matting just over their heads. Jap voices
broke out, shrill with excitement, drawing rapidly
nearer.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly light showed, farther down the trench.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They’re coming in!” Barry snapped. “Wait till
they fill the trench, and then rake ’em with the
tommy-guns. Curly and I will lie down; the rest
of you kneel or stand and fire over us. Toss off the
end mat at the last minute.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Okay, Lieutenant—we’ll sure clean them out that
way!” muttered Fred Marmon. “That is, if nobody
lobs a hand grenade into <i>this</i> end of the ditch!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Evidently the Japs had no idea that the grenades
that had wrecked the tent might have come from the
trench. They proceeded to take the camouflage mats
off methodically, moving up from the other end.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry lay on the very bottom, with Curly’s elbow
digging him in the ribs as he aimed his weapon. It
was lighter now in their end of the trench.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>Taking a long breath, Barry pressed the trigger.
The trench erupted with fire and sound. He saw the
Japs nearest him crumple like rag dolls, one after
another, down the trench. They never knew what
hit them.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the further end, however, the doomed men saw
the licking gun-flames. Some of them tried to return
the fire—only to be riddled in the act. The remainder
started scrambling out of the death trap. Cracker
Jackson and big Danny Hale caught most of these,
but not before one Jap had lobbed a hand grenade.</p>

<p class='c014'>The missile, hastily thrown, landed outside the
trench, six feet from Hale and Jackson. Without a
split second’s hesitation, big Danny flung himself
upon the thing. In one motion he grabbed and flung
it. The grenade burst harmlessly, fifty feet away.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, however, bullets were humming over the
slit trench. The Japs were all outside.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Down, men!” Barry Blake shouted at Danny and
Cracker Jackson. “We’ve got to hold this trench if
we want to live.”</p>

<p class='c014'>All of the shooting now came from the direction
of the American advance. The Japs between the
attacking force and Barry’s trench were keeping their
heads down and their gun barrels hot. Their camouflaged
helmets offered difficult targets.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hold your fire until our boys blast them out of
those trenches,” Barry told his friends. “It won’t be
long now. Then we can see what we’re shooting at.
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>Curly, suppose you face the other way and see that
nobody snipes—”</p>

<p class='c014'>PING!</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry broke off as a .25-caliber slug glanced off his
helmet. The shock of it hurt his old head-wound
like a knife stab.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I see the beggar!” yelped Curly. “He’s in that
tree above the wrecked tent....”</p>

<p class='c014'>The raving of his tommy-gun drowned out Levitt’s
words. Tony Romani’s weapon joined it, firing
short bursts. Suddenly the shooting stopped.</p>

<p class='c014'>“One more honorable sniper bites honorable
dust,” chanted <i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i> navigator. “So solly!”</p>

<p class='c014'>From concealment in patches of brush and trees
the Jap field guns started to fire. They were lobbing
shells just over their trenches, feeling for the Americans
down the slope. Apparently some of the shells
landed close. Their result was simply to speed up the
attack.</p>

<p class='c014'>In a series of short rushes the two companies closed
in on the entrenched Japs. While some of them advanced
the rest poured a hot fire into the Jap positions.
Then the foremost Americans started hurling
grenades. In a few minutes much of the fighting was
hand to hand. Howling like wolves, the boys from
Montana, Ohio, and New York leaped into the Jap
front-line defenses and cleaned them out.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fred Marmon and Cracker Jackson wanted to
charge down the slope and join that fight, but Barry
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>forbade it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’d probably be shot for Japs,” he told them.
“And, anyhow, you’ll be more useful here when the
enemy starts to scatter.... Look there! Isn’t that
a bunch of ’em crawling out of a communication
trench? Once they reach the bush they’ll all turn
into snipers. We’ll have to head them off.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Fortress crew needed no urging. A fight in
the open was more to their taste than crouching in
a trench, any day. This time, with big Danny Hale
in the lead, they ran, stooping, through the grass toward
the outcropping of rock.</p>

<p class='c014'>They were within twenty feet of the enemy when
the Japs realized that they were Americans. The little
men tried to shoot, but the Yanks were too close.
Swinging his tommy-gun like a war-club, big Danny
Hale closed the distance. He took a bullet through
his thigh without feeling it, and mowed down two
Japs with one blow. His gun came to pieces, so he
dropped it and fought bare-handed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cracker Jackson was using his bayonet like a short
sword—inside his opponent’s guard. Fred Marmon
was swaying in a knife duel with a third enemy.
Tony Romani, his sub-machine gun empty, was
coolly picking his shots with an automatic pistol.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry had shot two Japs and knocked out a third
with his gun butt. Without stopping to make sure of
the last man, he turned to help Fred Marmon. That
was a mistake. A half-dead Jap is more dangerous
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>than a coiled cobra.</p>

<p class='c014'>As Barry turned his back the dizzy son of Nippon
clawed out a pistol and fired. Fortunately for Barry
the Jap’s aim was bad. The bullet drilled through
the calf of his right leg.</p>

<p class='c014'>Tony Romani’s quick eyes caught the play. His
pistol blazed twice. The Jap stiffened out, his weapon
sliding from his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>The nearest enemies were all accounted for, but a
movement to the right caught Barry’s eye.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Down, boys!” he said sharply. “There’s another
bunch coming out of the communication trench. I’ll
keep ’em busy while you reload your tommy-guns.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Throwing himself down behind a small rock,
Barry opened fire in two-second bursts. He must halt
the Jap retreat, and still conserve his ammunition
until the others had replaced their empty cartridge
drums.</p>

<p class='c014'>His strategy worked almost too well. The Jap officer
leading the retreat took Barry for a lone gunner,
and decided to wipe him out at once. Firing in short
spurts, he led his thirty-odd men straight at the outcropping
of rocks.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bullets pounded the stone behind which Barry lay.
They glanced off with wicked little screams. Once
rock-dust got in Barry’s eye, half-blinding him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Make it snappy, fellows!” he warned through
clenched teeth. “Our game will be up in half a minute.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>“I beg to differ with you, Lieutenant,” Curly Levitt’s
voice sounded at his shoulder. “Just watch
this!”</p>

<p class='c014'>His tommy-gun spoke, just as the thirty Japs
started their rush. Barry’s weapon chimed in briefly,
slamming its last bullet into the officer’s midriff. The
charging Japs flung themselves flat.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry rolled aside to make room behind his rock
for Fred Marmon. Sergeants Jackson and Romani
had now finished reloading. They were firing from
the highest point of the rocks, raking the enemy mercilessly.
Quickly the Japs realized that to stay where
they were meant sure death. Behind them the
Americans were mopping up the last trenches.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry had just joined Danny Hale in the shelter of
a half-sunken boulder. The big sergeant was trying
to puzzle out the workings of a captured Jap rifle.
Suddenly he glanced up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here they come, Lieutenant!” Danny Hale
whooped. “No time to reload now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Dropping his tommy-gun, Barry whipped out his
bayonet. At Danny’s heels he vaulted the boulder.
The Japs who dived through the hail of sub-machine
gun bullets must be met with cold steel.</p>

<p class='c014'>The shooting fizzled out. Now all the fighting was
hand-to-hand. Barry bayoneted a monkey-like figure
who had leaped upon Fred Marmon’s back. Turning,
he glimpsed Danny Hale wielding his Jap rifle
like a pitchfork. Just in time, he leaped aside to
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>dodge an enemy bayonet thrust and grapple with
the man.</p>

<p class='c014'>He blocked a vicious kick with his knee, but his
wounded leg gave way. The next instant he was rolling
on the ground, with the Jap’s buck teeth snapping
at his throat, and the Jap’s knife slashing his
ribs.</p>

<p class='c014'>Desperately he twisted aside and jabbed with his
bayonet. His enemy screeched and went limp.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another mob of helmeted figures came bounding
through the tall grass. Barry heaved the dead Jap
aside, and came up on one knee. Sweat stung his
eyes, blurring them. He gripped his bayonet for a
last thrust.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hold it, man!” yelped a Yankee voice. “Don’t
you know your friends?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The newcomers were infantrymen, arriving just
too late for the finish. They had popped out of the
communication trench and were looking for more
Japs. With them was a medical-corps man—the same
one who had attended Barry in the field dressing
station. Seeing Barry’s new wounds, he whipped out
a hypodermic needle, and drove it home before the
young flier knew what was happening.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You bonehead!” Barry cried. “I’m only scratched.
Now you’ve fixed me so I can’t carry on. There’s a
lot of mopping up to do. Those Jap field guns—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ve plenty of men to take care of them, sir,”
the corporal interrupted. “If the Lieutenant will permit
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>me to contradict him, wounds two and three
inches deep are hardly scratches. They need to be
stuffed with sulfa powder—not dirt. And besides
that, sir, you’ve lost a lot of blood.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, have it your own way,” sighed Barry, as the
swift-acting drug began to take effect. “Got a drink
of water handy? I’m thirsty as a fried fish.”</p>

    <div>LIEUTENANT IN WHITE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Barry’s next impression was as startling as a vision
of something unearthly. A girl with big, blue eyes
and a crisp white uniform, was pushing something
into his mouth. The thing was a thermometer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who—where—whap happumed...?” Barry
mumbled in bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c014'>The blue-eyed vision touched her lips. A red-gold
curl that had escaped from her cap dangled as she
shook her head. She took Barry’s wrist in a light,
expert grasp and compared his pulse-beats with her
watch. The seconds, it seemed to him, passed with
agonizing slowness.</p>

<p class='c014'>A glance about him showed a regular hospital
ward. The beds were occupied by young fellows
dozing, reading, listening to the tuned-down radio.
This couldn’t be New Guinea! But where was it?
And <i>how long</i> was it since the Battle of Grassy Ridge,
when that Jap had tried to bite his throat, and....</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’re in a base hospital in Queensland, Australia,”
the nurse murmured, just as if she had been
reading his thoughts. “You have been here for a
week. As long as your fever continued you were
kept under the new sleeping drugs. I don’t think
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>you’re very bright, Lieutenant—getting into a second
fight before your head wound had started to heal.
But your blood seems to fight germs as hard as you
fought the Japs. You’re disgustingly healthy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you’re distractingly beautiful, Lieutenant!”
Barry retorted. “Nevertheless, feasting my eyes on
you doesn’t fill my empty stomach. How about
bringing me a T-bone steak—rare?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The blue-eyed nurse made a face at him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All you deserve is a can of bully-beef,” she declared.
“But I’ll see what I can do.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry’s steak turned out to be bacon and toast.
At his groan of disappointment, Nurse Stevens
threatened to take it away. In fact, Barry had to
apologize and promise to make no more complaints
before she would let him eat anything.</p>

<p class='c014'>Not many days passed, however, before Barry
Blake was actually eating steaks and calling Lieutenant
Moira Stevens by her first name. He started
that on the first evening that she helped him to walk
from the ward to the canopied ramp that surrounded
the hospital.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why won’t you tell me anything about Captain
O’Grady?” he asked as she took the deck chair beside
him. “You admitted he was sent here from the New
Guinea airfield. If he’s dead, I’m well enough to
stand the news without bursting a blood vessel.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lieutenant Stevens turned her clear, steady gaze
on Barry’s face.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>“You think the world of Captain O’Grady, don’t
you?” she murmured. “How long did you know him
before he was wounded?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Less than two weeks,” Barry Blake responded.
“Somehow time doesn’t count much with wartime
friendships. It seems as if I’d known you for months—Moira.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A low laugh bubbled in the girl’s throat. It wasn’t
a giggle—just a good-humored, friendly chuckle.
Lieutenant Moira Stevens rose several points in Barry’s
estimation because of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I guess I can safely tell you the latest news about
Captain O’Grady now,” she said, changing the subject.
“I heard the doctor say this morning that he
is out of danger. When you first came to your senses
the captain was just hanging between life and death.
If I’d told you the truth then, you might have worried
yourself back into a fever.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry did not speak. He gazed across the clearing
at a row of tall cocoanut palms. All at once the
tropical night seemed very beautiful.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So the Old Man is here—in this hospital,” he said
at last. “When do you think I might see him? I—I’d
like to talk with him about <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i>
... tell him she’s not beyond repair.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll ask the medical officer in charge, Barry,” the
girl promised, as she rose to her feet. “Come, now!
It’s time you were getting to bed. Take my arm—that’s
it—and we’ll go back to the ward.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>The following day Moira took Barry to see his
Old Man for a three-minute period. Captain
O’Grady looked shockingly thin. His wide, humorous
mouth was drawn with lines of pain, but his blue
eyes had the same smile that Barry remembered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What brought you here, Barry?” he asked as he
released his co-pilot’s hand. “Another raid on Rabaul?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing so pleasant,” Barry grinned. “The Japs
raided our airport the next night after you came to
this hospital. The raid was a cover-up for a landing
of paratroops and field guns on a ridge above the
field. I got cut up a few days later helping to clean
them out with tommy-guns and grenades. All of
<i>Rosy’s</i> crew went along and had a great time.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Captain O’Grady’s face sobered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I see,” he murmured. “The Jap guns had shot
up the field so you couldn’t get any planes off to
bomb them. You boys were wrong, though. You
had no right to risk half a dozen highly trained Fortress
men in a land skirmish. Why did you do it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s hardly a fair question, Captain!” Moira
Stevens broke in. “You’d have wanted to go yourself
if you’d been there. Would you be happy, sir,
sitting in the shade of your plane while your friends
were fighting to save it for you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nurse Stevens,” the Old Man replied with a wry
smile, “you’ve knocked out all my guns. I’m completely
at your mercy, and you know it.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>“In that case, sir,” Moira said, “Lieutenant Blake
and I will leave you to make the best landing you
can.... Come along, Barry! Time is up.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As she pulled the young co-pilot toward the door
he turned for a last word.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll be back to see you again as soon as the nurse
will let me, Captain,” he said. “And, by the way
sir, <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> is only grounded until she
can get repairs. I—er—thought you’d like to know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In his later conversations with the Old Man,
nothing was ever said about the Captain’s missing
arm. They talked as though one of these days would
see him again at the wheel of a flying fort. But both
men knew that it was all talk. Before long Tex
O’Grady would be back at home in the States with
the only person in the world that he loved better
than his warplane—sweet Mrs. O’Grady herself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Six weeks from the day he came to the Queensland
hospital, Barry Blake received his new orders. He
was to report at the new airplane repair base immediately
upon being discharged.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry was exultant. He demanded that Moira
bring the medical officer in charge to examine him
at once. For the past week, he told her, he had been
feeling more like a prisoner than a patient—without
even a prisoner’s excuse for sticking around.
Furthermore, he declared, a certain blonde, blue-eyed
lieutenant had been neglecting him shamefully.</p>

<p>“<i>I’ll Be Back as Soon as the Nurse Will Let Me.</i>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>Moira Stevens wrinkled her pretty nose at him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“As a nurse I have no interest in perfect physical
specimens,” she replied. “Sick men are my job. But
if you haven’t forgotten me when this war is over, it
might be fun to get together and compare notes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She flashed him a smile that took the chill out of
her words.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hmmm!” murmured Barry as she swept out of
the ward with a rustle of starched uniform. “They
don’t make ’em any finer than Lieutenant Moira
Stevens. And I mean, <i>definitely</i>!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The colonel in charge gave Barry an examination
that overlooked nothing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’re fit for service, Lieutenant,” he said. “If
you were my age, you’d be in bed for another six
weeks. Be thankful that nineteen years heals just
twice as fast as forty-five! Er—by the way—at eleven
thirty you will report to Captain O’Grady on the
west ramp outside the hospital. That is all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry had intended to see the Old Man before
leaving, but being <i>ordered</i> to do so puzzled him. He
glanced at his watch and saw that it was already ten-thirty.
He would have just comfortable time to
shave, dress, and check over his few personal effects
that had been sent from the New Guinea airport.</p>

<p class='c014'>As he stepped out onto the west ramp, the sight
of several “brass hats” halted him in his tracks. A
mere second lieutenant had no place in such company!
Then he glimpsed Captain O’Grady in a
wheelchair, chatting with the highest-ranking officer.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>Barry glanced at the time—eleven-thirty. Recalling
that he was there by order of the colonel gave
him courage. He waited until O’Grady recognized
him, then stepped forward and saluted.</p>

<p class='c014'>“General Morse,” the captain said with grave
formality, “this is Lieutenant Barry Blake, who
brought our crippled Fortress home after the raid on
Rabaul. Although wounded, he landed the plane
under almost impossible conditions, risking his own
life to save mine!”</p>

<p class='c014'>As in a dream, Barry found himself taking the
general’s outstretched hand. He tried to make some
appropriate answer, but no words would come. All
at once he found himself the center of everyone’s
attention. General Morse was pinning something on
his breast. In the background the colonel and the
brass hats were standing at attention—to honor <i>him</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry caught his Old Man’s eye, and it steadied
him. He saluted, met the general’s handclasp, and
stepped back. The tableau of high-ranking officers
broke up and passed on into the hospital.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sit down with me, son,” O’Grady invited him.
“Moira Stevens will join us in a few minutes for
lunch. There’ll be just the three of us. You don’t
know how pleased I am, Barry, that I could be present
to see you decorated with the Purple Heart.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry touched the bright medal wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I feel, somehow, as if it ought to belong to you,
sir,” he answered.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>NEW GUINEA GARDENS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Reporting for duty at the Queensland repair base,
Barry ran into surprises still more bewildering.
The first was the news that he was promoted to first
lieutenant; the second, that he would be given command
immediately of a Flying Fortress. The ship
and crew, he was told, were now waiting for him on
the runway.</p>

<p class='c014'>Wondering if it were all some crazy delusion,
Barry hurried to the airport. For a moment it
seemed that he must be back in Seattle, looking at
<i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> for the first time. For there
she sat, with her inboard props turning slowly in the
sun, and her name painted clear on the fuselage.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was even a tall, wide-shouldered figure in
flying togs, leaning against the plane’s tail. He
looked like Captain O’Grady from a distance. But
he couldn’t be!</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry wiped his hand across his eyes, and walked
toward the ship. The tall fellow looked up. He
wasn’t the Old Man—he was <i>Hap Newton</i>!</p>

<p class='c014'>Hap let out a whoop like a locomotive and
charged down upon Barry Blake. The two friends
proceeded to do a war-dance, bombarding each other
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>with questions. The surprise was entirely mutual.
Hap had been based in another part of the South
Pacific until recently. His B-26 Marauder had run
out of gas near the northern tip of Queensland one
night, and its crew had bailed out. Only Hap and
the bombardier-gunner had made shore. Just this
morning Hap had been assigned to the <i>Rosy
O’Grady</i> as co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And now <i>you</i> are my skipper!” he exclaimed.
“It’s such a wild coincidence that I can’t believe it
yet.... But just wait, Barry—the shocks aren’t
over. Step inside and meet the rest of us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry turned to the open hatch, but he had no
chance to enter. Men were boiling out of it as if the
ship were too hot for them. In five seconds they
were all around him. Fred Marmon, Cracker Jackson,
Tony Romani, Curly Levitt, and Soapy Babbitt,
with his broken shoulder still a little stiff, but useable.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where’s Danny Hale?” Barry asked, the moment
they gave him a chance to speak.</p>

<p class='c014'>Silence, as stunning as a blow, answered him.
Barry’s face went white.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell me, boys,” he muttered through stiff lips.
“You—you mean that Danny—that he....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He got transferred, Barry,” Curly Levitt said
quietly. “It was just after the medical-corps men
carried you back to the dressing station on Grassy
Ridge. A bunch of us were trying to capture a Jap
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>field gun. We ducked into a slit trench and started
tossing hand grenades, but the Japs chucked them
right back at us before they could explode. One
landed in our trench. Danny covered it to protect
the rest of us—and just then it went off.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thanks, Curly,” Barry said in a choked voice.
“Sorry my question brought it all back to you. It—it
<i>is</i> easier, somehow, to think of Danny as simply
transferred.... Have they sent us a bombardier
yet?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They sent him—such as he is!” replied a strangely
familiar voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry jumped as if he had been shot. Through
the hatchway dropped a small, bandy-legged man
whose short blonde hair bristled like the fuzz of a
newly hatched duckling.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Chick Enders!” Barry cried, making a grab for
his old friend. “How did you get <i>here</i>?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The same way Hap Newton did,” answered
Chick, grinning from ear to ear. “I was the bombardier
who bailed out with him from the B-26.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Boys,” said Barry Blake, turning to face his crew,
“I know that in a few seconds I’m going to wake up
and find myself back in my little hospital bed. The
sawbones will be looking solemn and saying: ‘That
chunk of shrapnel went deeper than we thought.
It’s affected his brain!’”</p>

<p class='c014'>He cuffed back his hat and laughed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s too good to be true, finding you all here—and
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span><i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> too! I’m going to say hello
to her before she vanishes in a pink fog, or something!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Understanding chuckles followed him as he dived
into <i>Rosy’s</i> open hatchway.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll leave him alone with her for a few minutes,”
Curly Levitt suggested. “Mess call is about
due. Lieutenant Enders can wait here to show the
Old Man to his quarters.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was past midnight before <i>Rosy’s</i> crew talked
themselves out and fell asleep. In the morning,
Barry reported for orders. He learned that his new
battlefront base was to be another jungle airport,
farther west along the New Guinea coast. They
would fly the shortest route across the island’s central
mountain range, and carry a full load of bombs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not much excitement on the way,” Fred Marmon
commented; as the crew headed toward their
waiting ship. “There’s nothing in the interior but
mountains and jungles and wild men. Even the
Japs steer clear of it, they tell me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’ll have plenty of excitement once we reach
the northern coast, Fred,” Barry told him. “The
Japs have been punching back hard at our new airports.
They realize that, given enough bases for a
big air offensive, we can push them right out of the
East Indies. They can’t keep backing up forever,
and keep any ‘face’ with their people at home.”</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> took off as smoothly as she
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>had on her maiden flight. Except for the patched
places in her aluminum skin, there was little to
show that she was not a new ship.</p>

<p class='c014'>“As a matter of fact, she’s better than new, Lieutenant,”
Fred Marmon declared. “She’s been battle-tested.
Every part of her, except these new engines,
has stood up under the worst strains. She won’t fail
us, no matter what we ask of her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They patched her up in New Guinea—enough
to fly her back to this Queensland repair base,”
Curly Levitt explained. “Here they gave her a complete
overhauling. Most of her replaced parts came
from other wrecked ships—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Like Hap and me!” spoke up Chick Enders.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, you’re battle-tested, too,” Barry laughed.
“By the way, did either of you hear or see anything
of our old messmate, Glenn Crayle? After all the
surprises of the past twenty-four hours, I wouldn’t
be surprised to see him waiting for us at the new airport.
Would you, Hap?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aw, don’t talk about it, Barry,” his big co-pilot
replied. “I wouldn’t be surprised, either, but I’d
be pretty doggoned sore. The sight of that mister
would sour my stomach for the duration.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mine, too—unless he’s toned down a lot,” agreed
Chick. “This war does queer things to people. It
may have let the wind out of Crayle and showed him
that he wasn’t such a hot pilot as he thought. I hope
so, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>“I believe you’ve got hopes for Hirohito, too,”
Hap Newton scoffed. “Let’s forget Crayle until he
does show up—and I hope that event will be a long,
long time away!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The blue expanse of Torres Strait now showed
beyond the green of Cape York. For an hour the
Fortress hung above it at six thousand feet. Then,
almost before her crew realized the change, the high
grasslands of New Guinea were sweeping beneath
her belly. Far to the east lay the Gulf of Papua, with
a mass of cumulus clouds tumbling above it. Ahead
rose the island’s mountainous backbone.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let’s fly a little lower, Barry,” Chick Enders
said. “You won’t have to start climbing over the
central range for half an hour. I’d like to get a look
at one of these native villages, and give the local
hillbillies a thrill at the same time.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“All right, Chick,” Barry replied. “But we won’t
do any hedgehopping with a quarter of a million
dollars worth of Fortress. If the air isn’t bumpy I
might take <i>Rosy</i> down to five hundred feet—when
and if you spot a thatch-roofed metropolis.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t try to thrill ’em by dropping an egg on
the town pump,” said Hap Newton. “General MacArthur
has caused the word to be spread among the
tribesmen that United Nations airmen are their
friends. We wouldn’t want to give them the wrong
impression.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wonder how many New Guinea wild men
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>could tell the Jap ‘rising sun’ from our insignia,”
Chick remarked, “even if they were near enough to—oh-oh!
Look, Barry! Straight ahead on that little
grassy plateau ... don’t those patches look like
native gardens to you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>By way of answer, Barry eased the wheel forward.
In a long, flat dive <i>Rosy O’Grady</i> roared down toward
the plateau. Moment by moment the tiny
squares and oblongs of different colors took the
shape of cultivated gardens. Near by appeared a few
loaf-shaped native houses.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s your village!” Barry exclaimed. “Looks
like a busy place, too. They’re clearing more grassland
for garden space, if I’m not mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Looking down through the plastiglass of the big
bomber’s nose, her crew could distinguish twenty or
thirty human figures at one end of the cultivated section.
Suddenly the natives stopped gaping at the
diving plane. They ran for cover.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’re wowing ’em, all right,” whooped Hap
Newton. “Just see those grass skirts scatter! You
ought to be ashamed of scaring the ladies this way,
Barry!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They’ll have something to talk about for a month
at least,” laughed the <i>Rosy’s</i> skipper, as he pulled
back on the wheel. “Are you satisfied with this
glimpse you’ve had of native culture, Chick?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not by a long shot!” the homely bombardier
replied. “I wish you’d turn back for another look,
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>Barry. There’s something blamed queer about that
village. Several things, to be truthful.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a grim note in Chick’s voice that Barry
recognized. His bombardier was in deadly earnest.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Okay,” he said shortly. “Slap on the coal, Hap.
We’re going back for another look-see. What was it
that struck you as queer, Chick?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Since when do <i>men</i> wear grass skirts, or New
Guinea women wear their hair clipped short?”
Chick responded. “I had a better view here in the
nose than the rest of you did. I’ll swear to what I
saw. And, while we’re asking questions, will somebody
tell me when the natives of this country became
<i>market gardeners</i>? There’s enough cultivated
land around those dozen thatched huts to supply
food for ten villages.... Look down now and tell
me what you think of it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>For wordless moments every man in the cockpit
gazed at the orderly patchwork of little fields below.
Suddenly Barry grasped the truth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look at the pattern down there, Hap!” he exclaimed.
“They’ve broken it up pretty cleverly with
camouflage, but the cleared place is L-shaped. If
that isn’t an airport I’m cockeyed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then those birds in grass skirts—” Curly Levitt’s
voice gasped through the interphone.</p>

<p class='c014'>“—were <i>Japs</i>!” Chick Enders finished the sentence.
“Go as low as you dare, Barry, and see what
else we can spot.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>“Man all the guns!” Barry’s order crackled in the
headsets. “Cracker, be ready to strafe any antiaircraft
before they can pot us....”</p>

<p class='c014'>He broke off as the white lines of tracer bullets
streaked upward from a patch of bushes at one side
of the field. Other guns opened fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>Small bullet holes appeared suddenly in the
bomber’s fuselage and wings. But four of <i>Rosy’s</i> .50-caliber
machine guns were talking back—the twin
weapons of her bottom and tail turrets. Seconds
later she had swept out of range.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, whaddyuh know about that?” Hap Newton
blurted. “New Guinea Gardens Grow Grass-skirted
Gunners. Who’d ever believe that headline?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why didn’t they throw any flak at us?” Curly
Levitt asked. “A field as big as that ought to be protected
by more than machine gun fire.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The airport isn’t completed yet,” Barry pointed
out. “The Japs probably haven’t had a chance to
bring in heavier installations. There wasn’t even a
camouflaged plane in sight—nothing but those steel-mat
runways dressed up to look like vegetable gardens.
Of course it’s possible that there were some
bigger guns but no time to man them, before we
were past.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s worth risking them to give the field a
thorough pasting,” Chick Enders said. “Let’s go
back at about five thousand and give it every bomb
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>in our racks.”</p>

<p class='c014'>No shellfire greeted them as they made their run
over the Jap airfield. Even the machine guns were
silent. The grass-skirted gun-crews were fleeing
through the surrounding grass and scrub like scared
rabbits when the first stick of bombs whistled down.</p>

<p class='c014'>They left the runways looking like a raw, black
wound in the earth, with a thick cloud of dust hanging
over it. All their bombs had struck with the
accuracy of rifle bullets, five-hundred-pounders that
flung the twisted steel matting high in the air.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Get the exact position of this spot, Curly,” Barry
Blake said, as he climbed into the hot blue sky.
“The sons of Nippon won’t be using their little
mountain playground as long as our fliers can keep
an eye on it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s right,” agreed the <i>Rosy’s</i> navigator.
“We’ve wiped out an air base from which the Nips
could have raided Queensland, Port Moresby, and
any of our northeast airports with equal ease. And
we’ve discovered some of their latest tricks of camouflage,
thanks to Chick Enders. Headquarters will be
glad to know about it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For the rest of the trip <i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i> pilots and
bombardier kept their eyes peeled for suspicious
looking “market gardens,” but none appeared. An
hour after they crossed the height of land the ocean
was again in sight. Soapy Babbitt contacted their
new airport on the Mau River and received the
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>answer to come in.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the field came in sight, Barry noted that it was
scooped out of the tropical forest, not far from the
sea. A United Nations transport vessel lay just beyond
the beach. It was unloading by means of
lighters. In this manner the new airdromes all up
and down the coast would be quickly furnished with
equipment and defenses. The danger, of course, was
that the Japs might send warships to shell the fields
at night. They might even land troops a short march
from the field itself.</p>

<p class='c014'>All this passed through Barry’s mind as he circled
for a landing. He had experienced one shelling from
warships, and a worse one from air-borne artillery.
No base, he decided, was safe from a sneak attack.
In any war the main strategy must be to “dish it out”
to the enemy in heavier quantities than he could
return.</p>

  <h2 id='chap13' class='c015'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>MYSTERIOUS ISLAND</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>No familiar faces greeted <i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i> crew at
the Mau River airport. A new bomber command
was based there. Three more forts, Barry learned,
were due to join it within the week. Until they arrived
there would be no mass raids on enemy targets.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rosy’s</i> first job was a reconnaissance flight to the
northwest. There had been signs of enemy concentration
among the islands west of Point D’Urville.
Headquarters wanted to learn what it meant.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rosy O’Grady</i> took off with the first faint dawn
light. Her bomb racks were full. In addition, she
carried a few score of four-pound incendiary bombs.
She was “loaded for bear,” and eager for a fight.</p>

<p class='c014'>At 10,000 feet, Barry Blake turned westward. As
they flew along the coast, the gunners in the top and
tail turrets watched the sky for Jap planes. The
pilots and the bombardier scanned air and sea ahead.
Suddenly Chick Enders leaned forward on his perch
in the nose, with a shout of discovery.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What do you see now, bombardier?” Barry
asked. “Some more grass skirts?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Chick Enders ignored the gibe.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look at that little island, just offshore,” he said
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>sharply. “There’s a white streak stretching north
from it, like the wake of a ship.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is, at that!” cried Hap Newton. “A boat of
some kind must have put into a hidden cove there.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That island isn’t big enough to shelter any vessel
that could make such a wide wake,” Barry Blake
declared. “Could the island itself be moving,
Chick?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is!” the <i>Rosy’s</i> bombardier yelped. “The
thing is a Jap vessel camouflaged with palm fronds.
Give me a run on it, Skipper ... <i>now</i>!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry’s touch on the controls did not shift. Without
altering its course by a single point the flying
fort kept straight on up the coast.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chick groaned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why did you pass up such a chance, Barry?” he
asked. “We could have laid an egg right in the middle
of that floating brush heap.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Two reasons,” the young skipper replied. “First,
there are four ships at least in that floating island,
and two or more may be cruisers. Splitting their
formation would only prolong the job.... Second,
I want a better look at their scheme of camouflage
before we blow it to pieces.... Sergeant Babbitt,
you will radio the airport what we have seen, and
say that we are about to attack.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He swung the Fortress a few points to the left and
nosed down.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tail gunner from pilot:” he said through the
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>interphone. “Let me know as soon as that fake island
is out of sight.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A few minutes later Tony Romani’s voice came
through.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pilot from tail gunner: Floating island has
dropped below the bulge of the coastline.... Are
we going back, sir?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Right now, Tony!” the skipper told him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Keeping the land mass of New Guinea between
him and the Jap vessels, Barry turned his plane
around. Lower and lower he took her, until <i>Sweet
Rosy O’Grady</i> was skimming only a few hundred
feet above the sea. Tree tops nearly grazed her belly
turret as she swept over a blunt headland, into sight
of the camouflaged ships.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’re going over ’em at two thousand feet,
Chick,” Barry warned. “Be ready to drop a whole
stick of bombs on the target.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look!” yelled Hap Newton. “There’s a swarm
of landing barges between the fake island and the
shore. They’re crammed with Jap troops.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll take care of them later,” Barry said grimly.
“Here we go, bombardier.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Roger!” Chick’s answer came back ... and an
instant later: “Bombs away!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hard upon his words came the blast—a multiple
explosion so terrific that it tossed the great Fortress
like a feather. Later her crew found that it had torn
all the fabric off her ailerons and elevators.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>Barry climbed his ship, and came back. There
was no more “floating island”—only three burning
Jap transports and the two broken halves of a fourth,
just settling into the waves.</p>

<p class='c014'>A puff of smoke blossomed just beyond <i>Rosy
O’Grady’s</i> right wing-tip; another, to the left and
rear. The gun crews of the stricken transports were
only now reaching their weapons. <i>Rosy’s</i> sudden
re-appearance, close at hand, had taken them entirely
by surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake swung his ship shoreward and nosed
down.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll risk the shell-fire,” he said briefly. “Our
first job is to destroy those Japs landing on the beach.
Be ready to fire all guns.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At a thousand feet the big bomber roared between
the burning ships and the shore. Her nose and tail
and belly turrets spat .50-caliber death. Beneath
her the Jap soldiers in thirty landing barges fired
their rifles upward in frantic reply. Through the
side gun-port Fred Marmon hosed lead at the deck
of the nearest transport.</p>

<p class='c014'>Twice more the flying fort swept back over the
same course. Shells from the Jap ships missed her
narrowly. Some of the bursting antiaircraft fragments
struck her fuselage and rudder. But the Jap
landing force was practically wiped out.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sinking barges drifted aimlessly, filled with dead
men. Some of the soldiers jumped overboard, only
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>to die in the water. Curly Levitt with his side-gun
mowed down the one bargeful that made the beach.</p>

<p class='c014'>After that run, Barry did not turn his ship until
well beyond the range of Jap shell fire. At ten thousand
feet he swung back. The three Jap transports
were much farther apart. The nearest one was drifting
and burning more fiercely than ever. The others
were zig-zagging.</p>

<p class='c014'>A sudden sheet of flame shot up from the drifting
vessel. In a space of seconds her superstructure went
to pieces.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She’s done for,” Chick Enders said. “Give me a
run on the farthest one, Skipper. I’ll try to drop an
egg right down her stack.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hap and I will do what we can to help you,”
Barry answered, “at ten thousand feet. We have
those last two ships in the bag. There’s no need to
risk <i>Rosy O’Grady</i> at point-blank range.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Chick’s first attempt was a near miss—the Jap
helmsman was too good at dodging. On his run over
the second transport he scored a hit. The five-hundred-pound
bomb struck her stern, crippling her
steering gear.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nice work, bombardier!” Barry applauded.
“Now we can concentrate on the last target.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A shell burst from the stricken craft slammed
chunks of jagged metal through <i>Rosy’s</i> tail assembly.
The big bomber lurched.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tail gunner from pilot:” Barry spoke into the
phone. “Are you all right?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>“That flak missed the turret, sir,” Tony Romani
answered. “But I can see daylight through the fuselage
just behind me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The rudder and elevators still work,” Barry told
his crew. “That’s as near a hit as I want, though.
Let’s get this job done.”</p>

<p class='c014'>On his next run Chick Enders accomplished the
nearly-impossible. His bomb plunged down the
transport’s stack and exploded in her bowels. The
Jap ship simply crumpled up and sank, like an old
tin can.</p>

<p class='c014'>The one ship left afloat was burning fiercely from
stem to stern. No boats or barges had been lowered.
Those Japs who had survived the flames were now
swimming in the shark-infested water.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here come three of our forts from Mau River!”
Hap Newton cried, pointing to the east. “Boy! Will
they be sore when they see what we’ve left!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Just a few bones on a broken platter!” Barry
exulted. “We had all the cold turkey and cranberry
sauce. Switch over to the radio and let’s hear what
they’re saying, Soapy!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Few of the other crew’s comments were cheerful,
but Barry soothed their disappointment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You might possibly find a force of Jap warships
farther up the coast, sir,” he told the commanding
officer, Major Browne. “My guess is that they were
landing troops for a night attack on our airport. In
that case they’d be expecting some naval units to
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>come after dark and ‘soften up’ the field for them
with shell fire.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s good reasoning, Lieutenant Blake,” the
major agreed. “We’ll search the coast toward Point
D’Urville. <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> looks to me as if
she needs a little patching before she goes hunting
more trouble.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Rosy</i> needs bombs, too,” Chick Enders remarked,
as they headed for home. “She’s had a pretty good
day’s hunting, even if she didn’t finish her patrol.
By the way—how do you think those Japs rigged
their camouflage, Skipper?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“With rope nets, I’d say,” Barry replied. “I
noticed some of the stuff drifting alongside the ships,
after the first bombs struck them. I think they
strung their nets over the masts and superstructures
and fastened the tops of jungle trees to them. They
used bushes to cover the sides. The one thing they
couldn’t hide was the ship’s wake.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They’d planned to have all their troops ashore a
little after sunrise,” Curly Levitt put in. “If we
hadn’t come along, they would have left a force here
strong enough to take over our airfield and perhaps
two or three more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Five minutes after landing, Barry Blake and his
crew were making their report to the officer in command
of the airport, Colonel Bullock.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You men have written a great page in Fortress
history today,” the officer declared when they had
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>finished. “Four transports and thousands of enemy
troops sent to the bottom within a few minutes!
That would have been a nice bag of game for a
whole squadron. I have an idea that decorations
will be coming to all of you for this feat. You’ve
earned a few days’ rest, too, but I’m afraid you won’t
get it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We shan’t mind that, sir,” Barry said with a
smile. “We like action better than sitting around
and fighting mosquitoes. Is there some special
mission for us?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Colonel Bullock’s gaze shifted to the slice of blue
sky framed in the tent door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, not yet,” he replied, frowning. “But the
enemy is massing his strength for another big land,
sea, and air attack. Our steady gains in the South
Pacific have cost him too much. He is due to strike
back, hard.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a brief silence. Glancing at his crew,
Barry saw their faces tighten with eagerness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The sooner they come the better, sir—so far as
we’re concerned,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>The colonel rose to his feet, smiling.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That spirit will win this war for us, son,” he
said. “It’s won every war we Americans have
fought. But here at Mau River we’re still short of
planes and men. I shall see to it personally that
<i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady’s</i> repairs are rushed through.
In a day or two we may need her—badly!”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>DOGFIGHTING FORTRESS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Three days passed without news of any Jap naval
maneuvers. That was not surprising, for the weather
was frightful. The regular bombing runs from Henderson
Field to Rabaul and Gasmata had been called
off because of it. Two reconnaissance planes were
missing—probably wrecked by those unspeakably
fierce South Pacific squalls. It seemed unlikely that
enemy warships would be out.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nevertheless, Colonel Bullock was nervous.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Japs have used bad weather as a screen for
their movements before now,” he pointed out to
Barry Blake. “If they wanted to risk getting off
course and piling up on a reef, they could sneak up
within striking distance of this coast, and land their
troops when the fog lifts.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> is ready to take off the minute
you give permission, sir,” Barry responded.
“We’ll gladly take the chance of running into a
squall. All of us would rather be upstairs fighting
the weather than stewing in our own juice down
here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The colonel met Barry’s eyes, and grinned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You mean you’d risk anything for a chance to
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>bomb the Japs,” he chuckled. “All right, Blake!
You can take off at dawn tomorrow, wind or no wind.
Head eastward toward Rabaul, then swing around
by the Admiralty Islands. The Japs might even send
a convoy from Truk, their big base to the north.”</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i> crew was jubilant when they
heard the order. The fog, the bugs, the everlasting
sticky heat of Mau River made idleness a torture.
That night they crawled under their mosquito bars
and fell sound asleep without the usual “bull session”
of complaints.</p>

<p class='c014'>The fog had lifted a little when they finished their
pre-dawn breakfast and headed for the runway.
<i>Rosy’s</i> four engines were whooping it up as the
greaseballs warmed them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s real music!” Fred Marmon shouted to
Barry. “If they run as sweetly as that today, no
storm’s going to worry us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She’s bombed up. I saw to that last night,” said
Chick Enders at Barry’s elbow. “They’re all half-ton
babies. If we should spot a Jap convoy, we’ll be set
to slam it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“If!” repeated Curly Levitt, the navigator. “It’s
a pretty big ‘if,’ even granting that there is a convoy
at sea. There won’t be many holes in this cloud ceiling,
I’m afraid....”</p>

<p class='c014'>His voice faded out beneath the thunder of five
thousand horses, as <i>Rosy O’Grady</i> strained at her
braked wheels. The engine roar died down suddenly,
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>a moment later, and the mechanics slid out
of the hatch. The sergeant in charge made a circle
with his thumb and finger, indicating “Okay!” Barry
Blake nodded, and plunged into <i>Rosy’s</i> dim interior.</p>

<p class='c014'>The runway was a vaguely lighter strip down the
center of the field as they took off. It dropped away,
as lightly as a streak of fog. Hap Newton touched
the lever that raised the wheels. Suddenly the blanketing
mist closed them in completely.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the first hour Barry flew by instruments. Then,
just off the western tip of New Britain, the air about
them cleared. No loom of Arabia ever wove such
gorgeous colors as the rising sun now spread over the
cloud rug below <i>Rosy’s</i> broad wings. Among deep
blue shadows the rolling vapors gleamed with gold
and pink.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the bomber’s transparent nose, Chick Enders
gazed at the scene, open-mouthed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fellows,” he said in a voice of wonder. “That’s
a sight worth any flier’s life. It’s Heaven’s art work,
fresh from the hand of God!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Nobody else spoke. Chick Enders had expressed
the feeling of every man in the plane who had a
view of the colors below. Soon, however, the cloud
painting changed, the gold growing whiter and more
brilliant, the blue and pink fading out.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fifty miles farther on a gap appeared, and through
it the white-capped ocean. For nearly an hour the
water remained in sight. A hundred miles from
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>Rabaul the ceiling closed again, and Barry turned
his Fortress back on the second leg of a big triangle.</p>

<p class='c014'>No more breaks appeared until they were halfway
to the Admiralty Islands. Here the clouds were
higher, with small gaps in them that opened and
closed as the winds whipped the masses of vapor
along. Below them the ceiling seemed to be several
hundred feet above the sea.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m going down, Hap,” Barry Blake announced.
“We won’t be able to see as far as we’d like to, but
we’re doing no good up here above the ceiling. Besides,
I have a hunch....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Play it, then,” Hap Newton advised. “In this
game a bit of a hunch is sometimes worth a barrel
of reasoning. Chick, be ready with that bombsight!
We might come out right over a Jap battlewagon!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The bomber sank through the fluffy cloud mass
like a swooping eagle. For a moment her pilots could
see nothing outside. Barry kept his eyes glued to the
altimeter: a thousand feet, nine hundred, eight hundred—Suddenly
they were through, with the rolling
ocean so near that its white-topped waves seemed to
reach up for them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hastily Barry pulled out of his shallow dive, and
climbed for the clouds. His hunch had been right,
as the shouts of Hap Newton and Chick attested.
Spread out over a twenty mile area were a dozen
large vessels.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Jap convoy!” Hap cried. “No doubt about
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>it—they’re heading southwest toward New Guinea.
Let’s give ’em all we’ve got—”</p>

<p class='c014'>CRANG!</p>

<p class='c014'>The blast of a small-caliber shell inside <i>Rosy’s</i>
fuselage shocked her crew into grim alertness. Two
seconds later her top turret guns chattered. Empty
shell cases tumbled smoking to the floor behind
Barry, as he zoomed the Fortress into the nearest
mass of clouds.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where is he, Soapy?” the young pilot asked
through clenched teeth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Right on the other side of this cloud, last I saw
of him,” replied the radioman-gunner. “He’s a big
Jap twin-float bomber ... looks like an <i>Aichi</i> T98.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Two 20-mm. cannon and four fixed wing guns,”
stated Barry, recalling what he had learned of the
T98’s armament. “Unless he gets in some lucky shots
our .50-calibers ought to be a match for him. We’re
going after that baby, and blast him out of the air!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The broken clouds opened out suddenly, revealing
the two planes flying almost abreast, and barely
a stone’s throw apart. They opened fire together.
Now it was <i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i> full broadside that came
into play—nose, tail and side guns, spitting bullets
that could chew chunks out of railroad tracks.</p>

<p class='c014'>Rows of holes like stitching appeared here and
there in the <i>Aichi’s</i> fuselage, but the “greenhouse”
of the Jap plane appeared bulletproof. <i>Rosy’s</i> slugs
struck it and bounced away at right angles. Inside
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>could be seen the Jap gunners, hunched over their
weapons, their faces drawn and tense. Smoke drifted
from the hot muzzles of their cannon.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rosy O’Grady</i> was taking punishment. Her fin
and rudder looked like a slice of Swiss cheese. Shell
holes gaped in her fuselage. Shell fragments were
whizzing about her interior—thin, jagged bits of steel
with cutting edges. Every gunner was nicked and
bleeding, yet all stuck by their guns.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Jap was catching plenty of trouble, too. His
left hand engine was smoking, and his forward cannon
appeared to be damaged or jammed. He made
a swift, left hand turn, trying to escape <i>Rosy’s</i> broadside.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry saw the <i>Aichi’s</i> play, and countered it. The
huge Fortress seemed to pivot inside the Jap’s half
circle. The strain of that sudden turn would have
broken anything but a fighter or a Fortress in two,
but <i>Rosy</i> took it. Her deadly broadside kept hammering
the now-frightened Jap.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <i>Aichi</i> nosed up, disappearing behind a long
streak of cloud. The shuddering racket of <i>Rosy’s</i> .50-calibers
stopped. Barry Blake wiped the blood
off his forehead, where a ricocheting shell fragment
had cut him. He winked at Hap Newton, who
smiled back despite a sliced cheek.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ball turret from pilot,” he said into the interphone.
“Watch out for a trick. That Jap might try
to dive below us and rip at our belly.... <i>There he
goes now!</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Shell Fragments Whizzed About the Plane’s Interior</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>“I see him, sir!” said Cracker Jackson, as his bottom
guns opened up.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry shoved the wheel forward sharply, diving
after the Jap. Smoke from the <i>Aichi’s</i> left engine was
drifting back to blend with the powder smoke of her
rear cannon. A shell slammed into Chick Enders’
left gun with a crack that resounded through the
plane.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chick lost balance as Barry pulled out of the dive,
barely two hundred feet above the water. The little
bombardier shook his numbed fingers, grabbed the
right-hand machine gun and swung it broadside.
Again the two planes were flying side by side, but
the Jap was licked.</p>

<p class='c014'>Flame burst from his crippled engine. A front
panel of his “greenhouse” collapsed. He swerved
wildly, nosed downward, and struck the water with
a terrific splash.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry zoomed his ship as steeply as he dared. In
that last minute of dogfighting he had flown within
two thousand yards of a Jap cruiser. Tracer shells
from the warship were streaking the air about him.</p>

<p class='c014'>In a tight climbing turn the big Fortress dodged,
heading for the protecting overcast of clouds. If one
of those five-inch naval shells hit her, she would be a
dead duck, and every man aboard her knew it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chick Enders was not satisfied with mere escape.
He turned to his pilot with a pleading expression.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>“Give me one crack at that warship, Barry,” he
begged. “What’s the use of coming out with a full
bomb load if we’ve got to take it all back?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry banked his plane, and climbed again. The
clouds enfolded the battle-torn Fortress like soft
fleece.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All right, Chick,” he consented. “I’ll give you a
crack at something, but not when they’ve got us
pinned to the wall. It’s more important to get the
report of this convoy back to headquarters than to
sink a ship. Soapy, get on the air and let me talk to
the base.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Circling at reduced speed within the sheltering
cloud blanket, Barry radioed a brief report of the
convoy’s location, direction, and probable size.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Shot down twin-float <i>Aichi</i> T98 that attacked
us,” he concluded. “We’re going back to leave a
few calling cards on the Jap’s decks.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Roaring down through the ceiling, Barry spotted
the circle of flame that still marked the grave of the
<i>Aichi</i>. Two vessels of the convoy were steaming past
it on either side. The nearer was a big, troop-carrying
destroyer. The farther was a cargo vessel of six
thousand tons.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll take the destroyer first,” yelped Chick Enders,
cuddling his bombsight.</p>

<p class='c014'>They were so near that the Jap gunners had no
time to swing their heavier guns. The shots that they
aimed flew wild. Already the destroyer’s deck was
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>almost beneath. From stern to bow <i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i>
shadow swept over the doomed warship.</p>

<p class='c014'>The thousand-pound bomb went through her
deck as through paper, and exploded in her bowels.
The destroyer broke in two, spewing into the waves
shapeless things that had been men and machinery.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now for that cargo tub!” cried Chick, his voice
high pitched with excitement.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry banked around and came at the Jap
freighter head-on. It was a dangerous maneuver, for
a cruiser scarcely a mile away had opened fire. Flak
was coming near enough to make the air bumpy,
and there was no chance to dodge while making a
bombing run. Barry hugged tight to the ceiling at a
scant thousand feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll go over at eight hundred, Chick,” he said
quickly. “They’re shooting too close.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Before he had finished speaking, Chick’s fingers
were busy at the bombsight’s knobs, compensating
for the intended drop. The Fortress dipped abruptly.
The freighter’s deck flashed beneath. Two hundred
feet above, the cruiser’s shells burst—where <i>Rosy</i>
would have been, had not Barry changed his altitude
at the right instant.</p>

<p class='c014'>The shock of them was almost simultaneous with
the wallop of the bomb blast. Chick had laid his
half-ton “egg” on the freighter’s stern, blowing it
clean off. As the vessel settled in the water a column
of smoke and flame poured upward from the torn
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>deck.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good boy, Chick!” said Barry quietly. “And now
we’ll take that somewhat despised but highly appropriate
action known as <i>scramming</i>. The whole task
force will be gunning for us now—not to mention
whatever planes the Jap cruiser may try to launch.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hap Newton turned and waved mockingly astern.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t worry, Tojo—we’ll be back, with plenty of
company,” he said. “You’re going to be honorable
shark-meat about twenty-four hours from now!”</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> plunged into the clouds and
leveled off for Mau River, three hundred miles away.
The wet mist whipped through her gaping wounds.
The torn edges of her metal skin hummed and
shrieked in the wind, but her four mighty engines
thundered in unbroken harmony. She was still fit to
fight.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Speaking of shark-meat,” Fred Marmon’s voice
came over the interphone, “would somebody be kind
enough to slap a bandage on my back? It feels like a
cubed steak.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll do it, Fred, if you’ll tie up my right shoulder,”
Curly Levitt responded. “I’ve got the first-aid
kit here.... Anybody else need patching up?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My ear feels like something the cat brought in,”
came Tony Romani’s voice from the tail turret. “I
think there’s some shrapnel sticking in my ribs, too,
but that can wait. You fellows fix yourselves up
first.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>All of the crew had some wounds, but none of
them were dangerous. <i>Rosy’s</i> pilots had escaped with
scratches. Chick Enders had a bruised hand and a
cut on his leg. Their hurts were just enough to get
them “warmed up for a real fight,” as Hap Newton
put it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When we land, we’ll stick with <i>Rosy</i> until she’s
bombed and serviced for another run,” Chick suggested.
“Only the pilots need to report to Colonel
Bullock, and he won’t ground them for a couple of
scratched faces. That way, we can take off with the
other planes for the all-out attack.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The plan was unanimously approved, but it was
doomed to failure. <i>Rosy O’Grady</i> made a three-point
landing, like the perfect lady she was, but as she
rolled to a stop, Chick Enders groaned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s Colonel Bullock coming out to us in the
jeep!” he exclaimed. “He’ll never let us take off
without a real inspection. And that means we’ll miss
the big fight!”</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>SLAUGHTER FROM THE AIR</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Chick Enders’ prediction was only partly right.
Colonel Bullock did order <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> and
her fighting crew grounded for temporary repairs.
But it was only for the rest of that day and night. To
smash the Jap task force utterly, every bomber that
could fly would be needed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Get those wounds dressed at once,” he ordered
the eight bloodstained ragamuffins who faced him
near <i>Rosy’s</i> shell-torn fuselage. “Then report to the
mess shack. Fill your stomachs and hit the hay. If
you’re all fit for duty tomorrow morning I’ll let you
fly. And—er—congratulations on spotting that Jap
task force, Blake! You’ve probably saved us a lot of
ships and fighting men.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry took the officer’s proffered hand, with an
embarrassed smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was just playing a hunch, sir,” he murmured.
“Chick—I mean, Lieutenant Enders—did the real
job. He sank a big destroyer and blew the stern off
a cargo vessel before we had to clear out. And the
other boys knocked that <i>Aichi</i> T98 out of the sky—simply
chewed her to junk!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My congratulations were meant for all of you,
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>Lieutenant,” the colonel replied with a twinkle in
his eye. “And so are the orders I just gave. <i>Dismissed!</i>”</p>

<p class='c014'>As Barry and his friends moved wearily toward the
hospital tent, a squadron of Mitchell bombers passed
over, heading out to sea. The ceiling had lifted to
three thousand feet. If it stayed there, Barry thought,
the planes would have little trouble in spotting the
Jap convoy.</p>

<p class='c014'>The field, he noted, was almost empty of planes.
Evidently they had taken off right after his radioed
report. The Japs would catch plenty of grief before
darkness shut down, but the real pay-off would be tomorrow.
By that time Allied airfields from all over
eastern New Guinea as well as Australia and the Solomons
would be sending planes to the attack. The
Japs would meet them with swarms of their own
land-based fighters. A gigantic air-and-sea battle
would be on, with the outcome impossible to guess.</p>

<p class='c014'>Much the same thing was passing through the
minds of all the crew, but they were suddenly too
tired to talk about it. The tension of battle had
broken. Now they were conscious chiefly of stiffening
wounds and the deep, physical craving for food
and sleep.</p>

<p class='c014'>The night passed in dreamless oblivion. It seemed
to Barry that he had just closed his eyes when the
bugle routed him out of bed. He glanced unbelievingly
at his watch. Yes, the hands stood at five-fifteen—half
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>an hour before dawn!</p>

<p class='c014'>“Roll out of it, Chick, Hap, Curly!” he called.
“This is our big day. If we’re not out there in time,
I bet you <i>Rosy O’Grady</i> will take off without us!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Groans and yelps answered him, as the tent mates
moved their sore bodies and found them more painful
than the night before.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come on!” urged their young pilot. “Snap out
of it or I’ll report the whole crew on the sick list.
We’ll miss our crack at the Japs, but—”</p>

<p class='c014'>He saw a boot come sailing from Hap’s side of the
tent, and ducked just in time.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All right, all right!” he laughed. “I’ll see you
lazy birds on the runway, if you’re too late for mess
call. So long!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hap Newton’s other boot caught him as he hurried
out of the tent. He picked it up, but paused in
the act of throwing it back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Setting up drill at this time of the morning, Lieutenant?”
said Colonel Bullock’s voice behind him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, sir—<i>getting</i>-up drill is more like it,” Barry
replied. “My crew slept too hard last night, and
they’re still in a fog.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Harrumph! I envy them!” grunted the colonel.
“Couldn’t sleep at all myself, last night.... But I
have good news for you, Blake. Your ship has passed
every quick test for serious damage, and except for
the holes that there wasn’t time to patch, she’s fit to
fly. That damaged machine gun in the nose has been
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>replaced. She’s been bombed up and serviced. I’m
counting on her—and you men—to give the Japs a
very special pasting today.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll do that, sir, and—er—thank you for giving
us so much of your time and thought,” Barry responded.
“Are we taking off with the squadron this
time?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes. Extreme right wing position,” Colonel Bullock
told him. “The take-off is in thirty minutes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry saluted and watched the officer’s tall, still
youthful figure stride away in the twilight. Behind
him the crew were piling out of the tent.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Just time to eat and run, fellows,” he said, turning
toward the mess shack. “The squadron takes off
at six.”</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c014'>Clear sunlight gleamed through the bottle-green
crests of the big combers that tossed and battered the
Jap task force. Gone was the protecting blanket of
clouds. Gone, too, was any hope in the mind of the
Jap admiral that he could sneak up on the Allied
bases without a costly attack from the air. Yet his
words were confident as he issued his orders to the
flotilla.</p>

<p class='c014'>A second convoy of fourteen vessels had joined his
ten during the night. With their added strength he
felt certain of success.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Inform the honorable captains that they will close
the intervals between their ships to five hundred
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>yards,” he told his chief executive officer. “Our
massed antiaircraft, plus the umbrella of our land-based
fighter planes, will beat off any air attack our
enemies may make. In fact, we shall utterly destroy
them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The executive bowed and hissed politely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We shall destroy them utterly,” he repeated.
“Banzai!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Green water crashed on the forecastle as the flagship
buried her bow under a giant comber. The
cruiser shuddered, heaved, and shook herself free.
The bow rose higher, higher, until the steel warship
seemed to those on deck as if she were going to stand
upright on her propellers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again her foredeck dipped, rolled, plunged into
the trough of a mighty sea. The antiaircraft crews
balanced themselves calmly on sea-trained legs. Their
eyes never left the reeling sky above them. They
breathed deeply, fingering the cold steel of their
weapons, waiting for the targets they knew would
soon appear.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a different story below the wave-washed
decks of the troop transport ships. There, packed in
the stifling holds like sardines, eighteen thousand
Jap infantrymen gagged and groaned. The throes
of seasickness gripped officers and men alike. It was
not deadly, they had been told, but it made them
long for death. Only their inbred habit of obedience
had kept them from shooting themselves or committing
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span><i>hara kiri</i> through the past week of inglorious
suffering.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly the flotilla’s antiaircraft opened fire with
a concerted roar. The transports’ long range guns
joined it. Their barking reports made the thin steel
hulls quiver. Then came the bombs.</p>

<p class='c014'>One struck an 8,000-ton troopship aft of the
bridge. A thousand Jap soldiers died in the flaming
inferno it made. Live steam from the wrecked engine
room cooked fifty other men alive.</p>

<p class='c014'>A second bomb blasted the stricken vessel. Its
superstructure leaped into the air and fell overside
in twisted pieces. The ship itself rolled, broke apart,
and sank.</p>

<p class='c014'>That second bomb was a credit to Chick Enders’
marksmanship. From a three-mile height he had hit
the wave-tossed Jap ship with the accuracy of a sharpshooter.
He had done it, flying through air that was
bumpy with antiaircraft bursts, ignoring the darting
Zero fighters that stabbed at his ship from above.</p>

<p class='c014'>Soapy Babbitt in the top turret and Tony Romani
in the tail were not ignoring the hornet-like Jap
Zeros. While Barry, Hap and Chick were concentrating
on their first bombing run, they knocked
down a plane apiece.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Flying Fortress squadron had dispersed, and
its members were making individual runs over the
flotilla. Now, however, the Jap flak was forcing them
to fly higher. One bomber already was down in the
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>sea. Several others had been nicked by shrapnel.
<i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i> stabilizer showed ragged holes, and
Cracker Jackson had been stunned by a direct hit on
the ball turret.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’re going upstairs, too,” Barry Blake decided.
“We won’t make so many hits, but we’ll make the
Japs disperse, so their flak won’t be so concentrated.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That suits us gunners, Lieutenant,” Fred Marmon
spoke up. “We’ll pick off a few more Zeros up
there where our Lockheed Lightnings are dogfighting.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Jap “cover” of fighting planes certainly
looked as if a tornado had struck it. The deadly but
unarmored little fighters were torching down all over
the sky. Others were fleeing back toward their New
Guinea bases, glad of an excuse to return for gas. The
reason was simple: plane for plane and pilot for
pilot, our forces were better. When the Fortresses
got “upstairs” there was not much opposition to deal
with.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rosy O’Grady</i> made three more runs before the
first wave of Australian <i>Havoc</i> bombers arrived beneath
her. Skimming the sea at mast-height, the
twin-engined attack bombers strafed the Jap decks
with a terrible hail of bullets. They passed over,
from stern to stem, and dropped their bombs at
point-blank range—sometimes down the enemy’s
smokestacks.</p>

<p class='c014'>On their heels came the North American B-26
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>Mitchells, repeating the same tactics, with even
greater effect. Back and forth like a great broom of
destruction they swept across the Jap flotilla. Enemy
gunners withered and died under blast after blast
of hot lead. Those who survived tried desperately
to swing their heavier guns into action, but that was
like trying to shoot mosquitoes with a pistol.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, all over a forty-mile area, Jap ships were
blazing. Barry saw three of them sink before Chick
emptied the bomb racks with near misses on a
dodging destroyer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll go back for another load,” he said, turning
the Fortress’s nose homeward. “How’s Cracker
Jackson?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Coming out of it,” was Curly Levitt’s reply. “His
right arm’s broken above the elbow, and his nose is
banged up. The ball turret took an awful wallop
from that ack-ack shell.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Better our ball turret than our bomb bay!” Hap
Newton remarked grimly. “We could have gone out
in a blaze of glory if that shell had hit a few feet
forward.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Much to Cracker Jackson’s distress, his friends
took him to the hospital tent the moment they
landed at Mau River.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have a heart, Lieutenant!” he begged Barry.
“This bum wing feels fine in a sling, and I could
shoot my left gun with my left hand. Please let me
go along this trip.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>Barry shook his head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s a compound fracture, man!” he replied.
“If you don’t get proper treatment now, it may
gangrene. Besides, your nose is swollen so big that
you couldn’t see around it to shoot. Lieutenant Levitt
will man your turret if necessary.”</p>

<p class='c014'>They left him, still protesting, in care of the field
doctor.</p>

<p class='c014'>“As a matter of fact,” Curly Levitt said when they
were out of hearing, “Jackson’s turret is so banged
up that it’s useless. It won’t turn, and only one gun
will fire. I didn’t tell him, because he would worry
about our going back without belly protection.”</p>

<p class='c014'>No more than six Jap vessels were still in the
fight when <i>Rosy O’Grady</i> returned with a fresh
bomb load. One cruiser, four destroyers and a small
cargo ship made up the half dozen. They were
scattered many miles apart, each trying to make good
its own escape. Between them the sea was covered
with rafts, landing barges, lifeboats and wreckage of
every description, but they made no attempt to take
aboard survivors.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the moment, the sky was fairly clear of planes.
Two other Flying Fortresses, a PBM flying boat, a
few Grumman Wildcats and Lockheed Lightnings
on the hunt for Zero fighters—these were all that
Barry Blake could see. The enemy had been definitely
shot out of the air.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll go after that cruiser,” the young pilot told
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>his bombardier. “Before she gets our range, I’ll dive
to three thousand, level off there for a quick run,
and then climb for a cloud. Ready, Chick?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Roger!” answered the little man in <i>Rosy’s</i> nose.
“It’s risky but it will give me a swell target. You
never learned this stunt out of a rule book, Barry!”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the co-pilot’s seat, Hap Newton sat nursing
the throttles, changing the bomber’s air speed from
moment to moment. Barry worked the wheel to
keep her constantly shifting altitude—foiling the ack-ack
gunners on the Jap warship. Abruptly he shoved
the wheel far forward.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Fortress headed down as if out of control.
Then, at three thousand feet she pulled out of it.
For a matter of seconds her run at the Jap cruiser
held true and level.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bombs away!” cried Chick Enders. “Let’s get
out of here in a hurry!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry put his Fortress into a steep, climbing turn
that strained her to the limit. Zigzagging, banking,
spiralling, he made the big bomber climb like a cat
in a fit.</p>

<p class='c014'>Far beneath, a sheet of flame was rising from the
enemy cruiser. Chick Enders’ bomb had opened
her oil tanks. Some of her antiaircraft were still
firing, but <i>Rosy’s</i> unorthodox actions fooled them
completely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Great stuff, Barry!” yelled the little bombardier.
“We’ll pull the same stunt on that destroyer to the
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>east of us. Let’s go!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We will not!” Barry Blake retorted. “I felt
<i>Rosy</i> groan too many times in that last crazy climb.
If I did it again she might really come apart. From
now on we’ll confine our bombing attacks to a reasonable
altitude. It’s better to waste a bomb than a
bomber, even if you don’t believe it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As they headed for their new target at ten thousand
feet, more bomb bursts tossed up white fountains
of sea water around the farther warships. Seven
or eight Fortresses were now on the scene. The
flotilla’s fleeing remnants were doomed.</p>

<p class='c014'>It had been a ghastly slaughter, Barry reflected.
Nearly twenty thousand enemy troops, not to mention
the crews of the Jap vessels, were either dead or
floating among the wreckage. An army and a task
force blotted out in two days!</p>

<p class='c014'>Mechanically he guided <i>Rosy O’Grady</i> on her
run. He was sick of killing. Even Chick’s jubilant,
“Bombs away!” failed to thrill him as it had before.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another hit! The thousand-pound bomb burst
the thin-hulled destroyer apart like a paper bag.
Swiftly she settled, stood up on her nose, and slipped
out of sight. There was no time to launch a boat.</p>

<p class='c014'>Five miles beyond, a number of tiny waterbugs
were leaving zigzag wakes in the water. They were
probably Jap landing barges, Barry thought,
crammed with armed soldiers from one of the troop
transports that had gone down. Now he saw the
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>cause of their erratic dodging—a flight of Mitchell
B-25’s diving at them, with tracer bullets streaking
from their guns.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Those Nips haven’t a chance, even if they’re
lucky enough to shoot down a plane or two,” Hap
Newton observed. “Their barges must look like
sieves already. More meat for the sharks!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“More butchery!” muttered Barry Blake. “It’s
necessary, of course. If those armed Japs ever made
land, they’d soon be killing our own men. That’s
what they were sent here for. But I’ve seen enough
slaughter today to make me feel rather sick.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Chick Enders didn’t say so, but he may have felt
the same way, after thinking it over. At any rate, he
seemed to have lost his uncanny marksmanship for
the rest of that day. His remaining bombs scored
nothing better than near misses on a desperately zig-zagging
destroyer. Another Fortress sank that vessel
as Barry turned his plane homeward.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Looks like some sort of a weather front, over
toward the coast,” Hap Newton remarked. “I hope
our base isn’t shut in by it. We’d have to find another
field or bail out....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tony can’t bail out, Lieutenant,” Fred Marmon’s
voice interrupted. “He’s bleeding to death
fast, from a leg wound. I’ve just found him unconscious
in the tail turret, and put on a tourniquet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A moment of shocked silence followed Fred’s
statement. Each man of the crew felt as if he himself
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>had received a deadly hurt. The fortress crew
was like a single body, its members knit inseparably
together by weeks of common danger, duty, thought
and feeling.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tie that tourniquet tight, Fred,” Barry Blake
said huskily. “Keep Tony alive, and I’ll manage to
set <i>Rosy O’Grady</i> down somewhere, ceiling or no
ceiling.... Soapy! Contact Mau River, will you,
and ask what the weather is there.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Leaving his position in the top turret, Sergeant
Babbitt sat down at his radio. In a few minutes he
had the field’s weather report.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Closed in,” it said briefly, “and so are all near-by
airfields. Better try Buna—or Port Moresby if you
have enough gas.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s the tough part of it,” said Hap bitterly.
“We used up our gas hunting down the Jap Navy.
Buna and Port Moresby are out! Our only hope is
to hit the silk.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Groans sounded over the interphone. Not their
own danger but that of Tony Romani, brought
unanimous protest from the others.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s <i>got</i> to be some place for us to set her
down, Skipper,” Fred Marmon declared. “You’ve
always been able to figure a way out. We can’t let
Tony down.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Curly!” exclaimed Barry Blake. “Get out your
charts and see if there aren’t some atolls or small
islands somewhere this side of that weather front.
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>If one of them had a beach long enough and smooth
enough—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I see what you mean,” Curly spoke excitedly.
“I’ll tell you in two shakes, Barry. There’s a sprinkling
of little islands between us and the western tip
of New Britain.... Here they are! Two or three of
them ought to be clear of fog right now. I’ll give
you the compass course....”</p>

<p class='c014'>A new spirit pervaded the bomber’s crew. Despite
battle weariness, their still painful hurts and
their worry over Tony, they crowded around Curly’s
map like a bunch of eager kids.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t get your hopes too high,” their levelheaded
navigator warned them. “None of these islands
may have a beach big enough to land a fighter
plane. If that’s so, we’ll lose <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i>
anyway.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And if we can land,” Barry added, “the place
may be swarming with Japs. Personally I’m for taking
the risk, but if there’s one man who doesn’t like
the idea, we’ll turn back and bail out over Mau
River. Tony would have a bare chance to live if we
pulled his ripcord and chucked him out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Silence answered him. It was broken finally by
Curly Levitt’s voice giving Barry the compass course
for an unnamed islet that they might hope to reach
ahead of the fog.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Okay, Crusoes, you asked for it!” <i>Rosy’s</i> Old
Man said cheerfully. “We’ll be in sight of Island
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>number one in about twenty minutes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In twenty minutes to the dot they sighted the first
white-and-green bump on the ocean’s surface. The
islet rose to a central peak about three hundred feet
high, covered completely with jungle. As the Fortress
swept over it at two thousand feet, her crew
voiced their disappointment. Such beaches as the
place possessed were narrow and rocky. A helicopter
might have found a landing place, but not a
bomber with a 90-mile-per-hour landing speed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Almost before the little peak had passed beneath,
Curly was laying the course for Island number two.
It lay a little farther to the north, and away from
the weather front. Its length, however, suggested
better landing possibilities, and it was barely fifty
miles away.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ten minutes later Chick Enders pointed it out.
As its low-lying shape became more distinct, the
crew’s hopes rose. The south beach, they saw, was
wide and free from stones, and the tide at this hour
was out. The only fault of this natural runway was
its slight curve, and the tiny brook that broke its
length.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll chance it,” the young skipper decided. “As a
matter of fact, it’s going to be a lot easier to set
down on that beach than to take off—even supposing
we can get more gas.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Climbing to a safe height, he turned and came in
for his landing. In order to make the most of the
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>beach’s length, he brought <i>Rosy’s</i> wheels down just
at the farther edge of the brook. The Fortress
bucked a trifle in the wave-packed sand, and rolled
to a smooth stop. Within her, six men cheered like
maniacs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hold it down, men,” Barry advised. “We don’t
know what we’re up against yet. Our first job is to
dress Tony’s wound. Then we’ll explore the island,
if there’s time to do that before dark.... Curly, pass
me the first-aid kit and a bottle of water, will you,
please?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Tony was still unconscious when they carried him
to the plane’s cockpit. His wound had evidently
been made by a piece of flak that had ripped through
his thigh like a dull knife. The arteries were bleeding
slowly despite the tourniquet.</p>

<p class='c014'>With small silver clips from the first-aid kit, Barry
managed to close the severed blood vessels. He
dusted a handful of sulfanilamide powder into the
wound, removed the tourniquet, and used most of
the kit’s gauze in a snug bandage.</p>

<p class='c014'>Straightening up, he pointed to the windows in
the nose and overhead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Open up and give him some fresh air,” he directed.
“The minute Tony comes to, we’ll make
him swallow some salt tablets and sulfadiazine, with
all the water he can drink. That’s all we can do....
Chick, you and Soapy will stay with him now, while
the rest of us look over the island. We’ll be back
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>before dark if we don’t run into any Japs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Okay, Skipper—we’ll hold the fort,” Chick answered.
“If you should meet trouble near by we can
cover your retreat with <i>Rosy’s</i> machine guns. Maybe
you’d better demount one of them and take it along
for an emergency.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Our pistols and the tommy-gun will be enough,”
Barry said, as he left the cockpit. “Those fifty-caliber
babies are too heavy to carry far, or to use without
a tripod. See you soon, fellows.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A five hour search of the island revealed no
human inhabitant. On the farther side from their
plane the Fortress men found the burned remnants
of a native village and a few unburied corpses. The
Jap butchers had evidently come and gone a few
weeks before.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry and Hap downed a half-wild pig with their
pistols. On their return to the Fortress, they frightened
a number of scrawny island chickens that flew
squawking into the jungle. It was plain that they
need not starve, Fred Marmon remarked, even if
escape from the island should be delayed for a
month.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve no idea of waiting that long, Fred,” Barry
laughed. “As soon as it’s dark, we’ll radio the base
to send a supply ship here. With a runway of steel
mats on the beach we should have no trouble in taking
off. That is, if the Nips don’t spot us!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Reaching the plane they found Tony Romani
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>conscious again. He had been swallowing salt and
water in quantity to make up for his loss of blood.
Despite the pain of his wound he greeted his friends
with a plucky grin.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All I want is a juicy beefsteak,” he told them.
“And mashed spuds and apple pie and—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’ll have to be satisfied with pork chops,”
Barry interrupted. “Beef won’t be on the menu
until we’re back at Mau River. The same goes for
potatoes. Dinner tonight will be roast wild pig,
palm cabbage, and cocoanut milk—with a vitamin
pill for dessert.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Ravenous appetites made the jungle dinner a
success, even though Tony dropped off to sleep in
the middle of it. The others literally cleaned the
bones of their little roast porker. There was no
campfire to enjoy, however: the light would have
betrayed them to any scouting Jap plane within
twenty miles. The moment the sun set, they kicked
sand over the coals and finished their meal in the
dark.</p>

<p class='c014'>Contact with Mau River was made quickly by
radio. A brief message, not likely to mean much to
listening Japs, gave their location. Barry added a
request for supplies, and arranged radio and ground
signals to guide the approaching planes to a moonlight
landing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The next thing,” Barry announced, “is to camouflage
<i>Rosy</i> so that she’ll be invisible from the air. As
soon as the moon rises, we’ll begin cutting vines and
leafy bushes. With only four pocket knives, it may
take us most of the night, but that just can’t be
helped.”</p>

<p><i>Ravenous Appetites Made the Dinner a Success</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>“There’s the moon coming up now!” Hap Newton
exclaimed, pointing to a glow on the eastern
horizon. “Out with those toadstabbers, gentlemen!
We’ll cut out a new green dress for <i>Sweet Rosy
O’Grady</i>—or fall asleep trying!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The camouflage was only half completed when
the first supply plane arrived. It was a big <i>Coronado</i>
flying boat, altered for extra cargo space. It brought
enough gasoline in cans to feed <i>Rosy’s</i> big engines
on the trip home, and it took Tony Romani back
to the field hospital. The next two planes brought
bundles of steel mats for the beginning of a long,
straight runway.</p>

<p class='c014'>Three days later <i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i> sunburned crew
had lost ten or fifteen pounds apiece, but the roadway
of perforated steel was completed. One end of
it was under water, owing to the curve of the beach.
An incoming wave might cause the huge bomber to
ground-loop at the moment of her take-off, but that
was a chance that had to be taken.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the men piled into their ship they tried not to
worry about this danger spot; yet there was no denying
the risk. Belted into his co-pilot’s seat, Hap
Newton warmed up the four big engines. Slowly
he increased the r.p.m. until <i>Rosy O’Grady</i> was
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>straining to be off. The mighty slipstream ripped
jungle foliage and tossed the fragments of her
camouflage screen.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let’s go, Hap!” Barry Blake said quietly.</p>

<p class='c014'>With brakes released the bomber leaped ahead.
She rushed down the narrow steel runway, her airspeed
gauge climbing fast. If one of her big wheels
should run off into the sand, disaster would almost
certainly result.</p>

<p class='c014'>Almost on the “step” she reached the wet end of
the strip. Spray flew from her right hand wheel.
The water tugged at the tire like a many-tentacled
octopus. Despite both the pilots’ weight on the controls,
it pulled her down. The right wing dipped
into a wave.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every man on board held his breath, bracing himself
for the shock and rending crash of a ground
loop.... Then, abruptly, the ship righted herself.
When Barry eased back on the controls she lifted
her twenty-five tons as lightly as a windblown leaf.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Home, James!” croaked Chick Enders, and a gale
of laughter swept through the Flying Fortress, releasing
her crew’s badly stretched nerves.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>SECRET MISSION</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The safe return of Barry Blake and his crew to
Mau River was celebrated the following night at supper.
The meal was the nearest thing to a banquet
that the army cooks could turn out. There was a sort
of program, too, mostly humorous. It recalled the
never-to-be-forgotten days at Randolph Field.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry himself was heralded as the “Big Dog” at
the moment of his entrance into the mess tent. Colonel
Bullock, as master of ceremonies, announced:</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Big Dog is coming in to land.... The Big
Dog is rolling down his flaps.... The Big Dog has
landed.... The Big Dog is waiting to be serviced!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Between each announcement, the second lieutenants
softly chorused: “Woof, woof! Woof, woof!”
When Barry lifted a large baked potato from the
serving dish it was announced that “The Big Dog is
getting bombed up.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At this point an exuberant woofer from Texas lost
control. Tilting his head far back, he gave tongue to
a genuine coyote howl that raised the hair on the
necks of more than one “effete Easterner.” The
bumptious ex-cowboy was penalized by being made
to sing “Deep in the Heart of Texas” with his
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>mouth full of olives.</p>

<p class='c014'>Following that there were speeches in praise of
<i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> and every member of her crew.
Tony Romani and Cracker Jackson received their
full share of glory, as wounded heroes. Finally <i>Rosy</i>
herself was described as the plane that “sighted convoy,
sank same, and retired to a desert island, where
she became a sort of Empress Jones, too proud to
come home and associate with her sister Fortresses.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After the celebration, Colonel Bullock asked Lieutenant
Blake and three other pilots to report to his
tent for a brief conference. Arriving a moment
after the rest, Barry noted that he was the only Fortress
skipper present. The others were twin-engine
pilots, who had made fine bombing records during
the recent slaughter of the Jap convoy. They were
Captain Rand Bartlett, Lieutenant Thurman Smith,
and Lieutenant Ben Haskins.</p>

<p class='c014'>The four young officers sprang to their feet and
saluted as the colonel appeared. Bullock waved them
to canvas-bottomed chairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve been asked to supply four of my best bomber
crews,” he told them, “for a secret and difficult mission.
What that mission is I don’t know myself, but
you are to fly B-26 planes. The orders from headquarters
stressed a high record of bombing hits.
You’re to take off before daylight tomorrow and fly
to Port Darwin. There you will doubtless learn more
details. Have you any questions, gentlemen? You
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>are at perfect liberty to pass up the job—in which
case I’ll choose some other crew.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake was the first to break the ensuing silence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think we all feel alike about it, sir,” he said
quietly. “It’s a big honor to be chosen by you under
these circumstances. But as Fortress men, my crew
and I might not measure up to the best B-26 performance.
Those Martin bombers are sweet little
ships, but they handle differently from a Boeing. We
wouldn’t want to let you down, sir—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know all that, Blake,” Colonel Bullock interrupted
with a smile. “I chose you and your crew
after a good deal of thought, just as I picked Haskins
and Bartlett and Smith. You’ve flown twin-engined
planes in Advanced Training School and you’ll get
the hang of your new B-26 on the way to Darwin. I’ll
supply you with a first-class tail gunner to take the
place of Tony Romani.... Now, gentlemen, for the
last time, do you want the job?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, sir!” chorused the four pilots.</p>

<p class='c014'>The C.O. arose. One after the other he gripped
their hands and wished them good hunting. In that
moment he seemed more like a proud parent than
their superior officer. The four young officers knew
that they had found a lifelong friend in Colonel Bullock.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Rosy O’Grady’s</i> crew, all except Tony and Cracker
Jackson, were overjoyed at their new assignment.
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>They lay awake talking it over until Barry curtly
ordered them to “drive it into the hangar and get
some sleep.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Rosy</i> will be laid up for a couple of weeks’ repairs
anyway,” Chick added in a loud whisper, “and so
will Tony and Cracker. We’ll probably be back by
that time. Nobody’s got any kick coming, so far as
I can see—unless it’s the Japs!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Out on the runway at five o’clock Barry’s crew
found their new ship waiting, complete with tail gunner.
The latter was a little bulldog of a man with the
map of Ireland jutting fiercely out of his helmet. He
was Sergeant Mickey Rourke from South Boston. He
greeted each of his new crew mates with an undershot
smile and a brief “Pleased to meet yiz!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Later <i>Rosy’s</i> crew found out that Mickey was the
lone survivor of a B-26 that had been sliced in two by
a diving Zero fighter. Mickey had bailed out of his
severed tail section unharmed and had swum ashore.
After two weeks in the New Guinea bush he had
walked into the Mau River base and calmly reported
for duty.</p>

<p class='c014'>The four Martin bombers took off by moonlight
and promptly headed southwest. Barry found <i>The
Colonel’s Lady</i> as Hap had named their new craft,
strangely quick and light on the controls, compared
with her big sister <i>Rosy</i>. Flying in formation with
the other three Marauders soon cured his tendency
to over-control, however.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>As the sun rose, tinting the peaks of New Guinea’s
high backbone ahead of them, he turned over the
controls to Hap Newton.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Easy on the stick, Mister,” he warned his big co-pilot.
“Those crowbar wrists of yours work swell at
the wheel of a Fortress, but this little lady won’t
stand for rough handling.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Finger-tip control!” chuckled Hap as he took
over. “I may be rough, but I can be oh, so gentle,
too, Skipper! Just watch me take her upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The bomber formation was climbing steadily, to
top the 16,000-foot range ahead. A bitter chill seeped
into the plane. The crew found themselves breathing
faster to get enough air. Automatically they reached
for their oxygen masks. Those things were lifesavers
when you got up above 20,000. Even at somewhat
lower altitudes they helped keep your head clear and
your stomach in place.</p>

<p class='c014'>At 18,000 the air was bumpy. The flight leader,
Captain Bartlett, took his bombers up to 20,000,
where it was colder but smoother. Beneath them the
great range was spread out like a relief map, with
patches of white cloud here and there showing local
rains.</p>

<p class='c014'>An hour later the immense blue bowl of the Arafura
Sea rose up to enclose them with its rim of
endless horizon.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’re like four tiny flies buzzing across a giant’s
washbowl,” Barry thought. “And yet this Arafura
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>Sea is just a little spot on God’s Footstool. Most high
school students never knew where it was before the
war. A flier certainly comes to feel his smallness in
time and space!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The four planes loafed along at about 200 m.p.h.,
to conserve gas. They dodged a thunder storm just
north of the Gulf of Carpenteria and swung back to
the southwest. At noon they were over Port Darwin,
Australia, with a heavy overcast obscuring sea and
land. Barry took over the controls in preparation
for landing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ceiling one thousand feet and dropping fast,”
came the airfield’s radioed report. “You arrived just
in time. In another hour we’ll be closed in.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“This weather may postpone our mission, whatever
it is,” Chick Enders remarked as they went
down through the wet cloud rug. “Looks like a general
storm coming over the coast.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s something for the brass hats to worry
about, Chick,” Barry Blake replied. “We haven’t
the haziest notion yet what we’ve come here to do—There’s
the field, Hap! It looks a lot better than the
one we left this morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Though his B-26 was still a bit unfamiliar to the
young Fortress pilot, he set her down without a
bounce. The field was hard and smooth, with only
a few patches showing where Jap bombs had recently
dropped. The lowering clouds, Barry remarked,
would probably keep enemy raiders at a distance for
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>the next few days.</p>

<p class='c014'>Reporting to the Operations Building, the Marauders’
four young officers were told to return immediately
after mess for instructions. The general
himself would be present, with other high-ranking
officers. All further information would be given at
that time.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mess call sounded as they left the place. In the
camouflaged mess tent, they found a number of flying
officers already gathered around rough tables.
Most of these greeted the newcomers with cordial
smiles, but there was one outstanding exception.
A rather handsome, sleek-haired second lieutenant
stared at them insultingly, then turned his back and
moved to a farther table.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Glenn Crayle!” exclaimed Hap Newton. “The
same swell-headed hot pilot that he was at Randolph!
Did you get that ‘dirt-under-my-feet’ look he gave
us?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hold it down, Hap!” Barry whispered. “No use
in stirring up more hard feelings. The whole room
heard you. After all, Crayle’s a fellow officer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He’s just as much of a sorehead as he ever was,”
muttered Chick Enders. “I’d hate to fly in formation
with him, for fear he’d pull some spite trick and
crash both of us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’d probably get ‘jeep jitters’ and scare the life
out of him if you were at the joy-stick,” Hap Newton
laughed under his breath. “Here come the brass
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>hats! We’d better take places at this table, near the
wall.”</p>

<p class='c014'>They saw no more of Glenn Crayle than his neatly
uniformed back until the meal was over and the
B-26 bomber officers assembled in the briefing room.
There, after another dirty look, the sulky pilot whispered
behind his hand to a hard-eyed acquaintance.
The pair of them glanced toward Barry’s group and
laughed. Whatever “crack” Crayle had made was
certainly not to the Fortress crew’s credit.</p>

<p class='c014'>The briefing room filled quickly, until the space
between the long table and the walls was filled with
the officers of four bomber squadrons. Facing them
stood the general and a rear admiral of the Navy.
As the former raised his hand, absolute silence fell
on the group.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Gentlemen,” the general said quietly, “this talk
will be very brief and, I trust, to the point. You are
to leave sometime tonight on a mission of high strategical
importance. Your objective is the Japanese-held
harbor of Amboina. As you know, this is the
enemy’s strongest East Indian base. We cannot at
this moment tell you why its demolition is so important
to our war strategy. Your orders are simply
to destroy every plane, ship and installation that you
can, cripple its defenses. Leave it helpless to resist
the regular bombardment forces that will follow up
your attack.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He paused impressively. In the silence Barry could
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>feel a rising tide of unspoken questions filling the
room. How, for instance, could four squadrons of
medium bombers effect such a complete destruction
as the general had described? Why not use Fortresses
and Liberators, such as were even now smashing the
U-boat pens at Lorient and Wilhelmshaven?</p>

<p class='c014'>“You, gentlemen,” the officer continued, “have
been picked from several bomber commands for a
task of utmost difficulty and danger. The planes
you will fly are B-26 bombers that have been altered
to carry twice their normal bomb load, and about
one fourth of their regular supply of fuel. Each plane
will lay a two-ton, delayed action bomb directly on
an assigned target, from mast-head height. You will
then go on to strafe the Jap aircraft in the seaplane
anchorage at the head of Amboina Bay. By that time
you will have just enough gas left to fly the six hundred
thirty miles back to Port Darwin—providing
you meet no interference on the way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are there any questions, up to this point?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Captain Bartlett was the first pilot to speak.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You mentioned that we should carry about one
fourth of our usual gas supply, sir,” he said in a puzzled
tone. “But the B-26’s greatest range with a one-ton
load is only twenty-four hundred miles. To fly
six hundred thirty miles to Amboina and back again
would use up more than half of it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For the first time a slight smile crossed the general’s
face.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>“You are quite correct, Captain,” he answered.
“However, I didn’t say that you were to fly from here
to Amboina. That is the little surprise we are preparing
for our enemies. Your three squadrons of
Martin bombers are already loaded on an aircraft
carrier which you will board tonight. Under cover
of the weather front that is moving northwest we
hope to approach within fifty miles of Amboina. The
flight deck of this carrier is quite long enough for
medium bombers. You’ll need a bit of verbal instruction
regarding the take-off, however. Am I
right, Admiral?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The naval officer cleared his throat.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll take care of that after we’re at sea,” he said
to the assembled fliers. “You won’t have to worry
about finding and landing on your flat-top in the fog,
as the Navy pilots would. Once you leave our flight
deck it’s good-by—until we see you back in port.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And now,” added the general, “we’ll turn to the
matter of targets. Here’s a map of Amboina Harbor,
with all the important installations marked. As you
receive your assignments, please note them down,
gentlemen. With a limited number of bombs, we
must have no duplication.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The target assigned to Barry’s crew was the radio
station at the extreme tip of Nusanive Point. Captain
Bartlett, Lieutenant Haskins, and Thurman
Smith were given the heavy coastal fortifications just
beyond. Other crews received the airfields across the
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>bay at Hatu and Lata and the antiaircraft batteries
mounted in the hills along shore.</p>

<p class='c014'>Amboina City, with its piers, its big coaling station
and its naval installations, offered the biggest
group of targets. A whole squadron was assigned to
hammer it with two-ton block-busters.</p>

<p class='c014'>At supper time the study of contour maps, targets
and enemy gun positions was still in progress. Nobody
had been permitted to leave the briefing room.
So great was the secrecy with which the whole venture
was surrounded that guards had been posted
several yards from the building, to keep anybody
without a pass from approaching it. Not until ten
o’clock was the order given to dismiss; but the evening
was not over.</p>

<p class='c014'>A dozen army trucks pulled up near the door.
The fliers piled in, and the vehicles roared away
toward the docks. There a number of speedy PT
boats were waiting. In these the hundred-odd flying
officers were rushed through the spray-filled darkness
to a point offshore which the steersmen seemed to
find by instinct.</p>

<p class='c014'>There lay the carrier, a long, dim shape that grew
rapidly huger until the speedboat paused close to her
towering side. Ship’s ladders had been lowered already.
Each boatload of airmen climbed hurriedly
to the dark port that opened into the ship’s bowels.
Behind them the PT boats roared away into the surrounding
blackness.</p>

<p><i>The Fliers Piled into the Army Trucks</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>Young Navy fliers of the carrier’s own company
came forward to greet the Army men and conduct
them to their mess. They were cordial chaps, perhaps
a little more formal than the Army fliers. They
stood treat for the newcomers with soft drinks and
there was a lot of pleasant small-talk. Finally they
got around to showing the bomber group their temporary
quarters.</p>

<p class='c014'>The enlisted members of the B-26 crews were already
on board, bunking forward with the petty
officers. In the morning they’d all get together and
each crew would be assigned a plane. From then
until the moment of take-off they’d be responsible
for its care.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry’s team took four bunks in a corner of the
large room assigned to the Army group. For the first
time in many hours they had a chance to talk quietly
together about the mission on which they had embarked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s a smarter stunt than any of the Japs have
pulled off,” Hap Newton declared. “B-25’s and 26’s
are usually considered too big to take off from a carrier’s
deck. I still don’t see how we can do it with a
double load, but the experts must have figured it out.
Each ship will be practically a flying bomb.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Flying Fortresses could do the same job from a
land base and do it better,” Chick Enders remarked.
“We’ve done skip-bombing with <i>Rosy O’Grady</i>. The
trouble is that she’s too big a target, and she cost a
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>quarter of a million dollars to build.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not only that,” Barry Blake put in, “but all the
forts that can be spared for this job will be coming
right in after us to hammer the Jap gun emplacements
in the hills. That’ll be high-altitude bombing,
if the weather is right.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The weather,” agreed Curly Levitt, “is the big
risk. There has to be enough fog or low-hanging
cloud ceiling to hide the carrier from Jap patrol
planes, right up to the last minute. But over the
island itself our forts and Liberators will need visibility
unlimited. If the meteorologists have guessed
wrong, it will be just too bad.”</p>

<p class='c014'>That was true enough, Barry thought, but it didn’t
worry him. The brass hats who had planned this
secret attack so painstakingly must know what sort
of weather they could count on. Meteorology was
almost an exact science nowadays.</p>

<p class='c014'>He caught sight of Glenn Crayle talking with his
co-pilot at the other side of the room. Barry could not
hear what they were saying, but Crayle’s cocksure
manner suggested his familiar, boastful line. Probably
the sleek-haired pilot was thinking of this Amboina
job as offering a splendid chance to make the
news headlines. At any rate, thought Barry, the fellow
must be a first-rate pilot, or he’d never have been
picked for such a mission.</p>

  <h2 id='chap17' class='c015'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>OUT OF THE FOG</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Flanked by two cruisers and four destroyers, the
big flat-top plowed through rain and fog across the
Arafura Sea. Her speed was low, since the weather
front was moving slowly. She must stay behind its
dark curtain until the moment came for her planes
to take the air.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since the B-26 bombers were not fitted to return
to her decks, there could be no practice take-offs.
However, everything possible was rehearsed. A special
catapult had been built to insure each bomber
flying speed before it reached the end of the flight
deck. The engines were checked and tested and
tuned until their engineers could swear to their perfect
condition. The new bomb releases were objects
of especial care. At the last crucial second as they
swept toward the target, nothing must go wrong.</p>

<p class='c014'>Just thirty-two hours from the time he had boarded
the carrier, Barry Blake sat at the controls of the first
“flying bomb” to be launched at Amboina. Hidden
in mist, the carrier had approached within forty miles
of the island. The B-26 was already in the catapult;
her Double Wasp radial motors were roaring at full
throttle. Every man on board was braced for the
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>launching.</p>

<p class='c014'>The shock came, jerking the pilots’ heads back
as their seats pushed them suddenly. The heavily
loaded Martin <i>Marauder</i> literally shot along the carrier’s
fog-swathed deck. Barry eased back on the
stick, and felt the deck drop away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’re flying!” Hap Newton said hoarsely. “I
never was so jittery taking off from a bomb-pitted
jungle strip. I’d been wondering whether that catapult
would boost us into the air or into the sea. How
does she handle, Barry?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Like a lady!” replied the young skipper. “I can
feel the double bomb load, but it’s balanced perfectly.
We’ll have no trouble with it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry glanced at his climbing altimeter. When it
showed a thousand feet he leveled off, heading due
north. An instant later the surrounding fog fell away
like torn gauze. The carrier had been keeping just
within its edge until the moment her warhawks were
released.</p>

<p class='c014'>Amboina Island rose like a deep purple cloud on
the northern horizon. In less than fifteen minutes
it would be directly beneath, Jap flak would be bursting;
tracer shells and bullets would be criss-crossing
the air. Already the Jap defenses must be seething
like hornet nests. Their plane detectors had probably
caught the first hum of Barry’s engines—now
multiplied by ten or twelve as the catapult launchings
proceeded.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>“Pilot from tail gunner,” Mickey Rourke’s voice
sounded on the interphone. “I can see four of our
planes jist comin’ out of the fog.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They’ll scatter when they reach the harbor,”
Barry remarked. “That will keep the Jap guns from
concentrating on any group of them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yeah, but how about us?” Chick Enders asked.
“We’ll get to our target before the others are even
in range.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“So what?” retorted Hap Newton. “The Japs will
still be blinking the sleep out of their eyes when we
slam ’em. And once we’re rid of this bomb load,
Barry’s going to make us mighty hard to hit. That
right, Skipper?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m not going to wait for that,” Barry told him.
“Do you see that fog layer hanging close to the
water? It reaches almost to the tip of Nusanive Point.
We’ll duck into it and fool any gunners that might
spot us too soon in clear air.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A long, shallow dive took them into the fog layer
two hundred feet above the water. And there, for the
next thirty miles, they stayed. When at last the mist
thinned to a few wispy streamers the swift little B-26
fairly hugged the water. Her target, the Nusanive
radio tower, loomed just ahead.</p>

<p class='c014'>The shore batteries had spotted her now, but she
was flying too low and too fast for them. The ack-ack
was bursting far above and behind her. Some of it
was aimed at her sister bombers who were now scattering
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>over Amboina Bay.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Listen, Chick!” cried Barry. “I’m going in low—just
clearing the roof of that radio station.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can’t miss it, Skipper!” the little bombardier replied.
“I’ll lay this two-ton egg right on their breakfast
table. Boy! Look at that gun crew duck for
cover.... <i>Bombs away!</i>”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry reefed back sharply, gaining altitude in the
few precious seconds before the delayed action blast
arrived. Without it he might find himself knocked
out of the air by the concussion.</p>

<p class='c014'>The plane jumped—like a baseball struck by a
giant’s bat. Her nose went down. With all his might,
Barry pulled back the control post. At three hundred
feet he leveled off, turning sharp right, to skirt the
steep slope of Mt. Kapal.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tail gunner from pilot,” he called. “What happened
to that radio station?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Everything, sir,” Mickey Rourke’s answer came
back. “The last I saw of the tower, it was headin’ for
the moon, with a few bits of the station roof taggin’
along behind. Your bomb must have landed in the
cellar.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Keep your eyes peeled for Zero fighters when we
start shooting up the seaplane anchorage,” Barry
warned him. “We’re moving too fast for them now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’ve got the best seat in the whole show,
Rourke,” put in Fred Marmon. “Babbitt and I are
missing all the fun, with our heads stuck into this
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>two-gun top turret. If we were flying <i>Sweet Rosy
O’Grady</i> now, we could see something of the countryside.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The countryside,” said Chick Enders from his
perch in the nose, “is going by too fast for me to see
much of it. Oh-oh! That ack-ack battery just ahead
has spotted us—”</p>

<p class='c014'>WHAMMM!</p>

<p class='c014'>BRRRRRRRRRR!</p>

<p class='c014'>The explosion of a Jap shell just above the hedgehopping
Marauder was answered by a two-second
burst of Chick’s gun.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That crew is out of action,” he said grimly as the
gun emplacement swept beneath him. “They came
a little too near to spotting us. Better keep below
the treetops where you can, Barry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Entering the little valley behind Hauisa Point, the
B-26 fairly skimmed the bushes. At the base of Mt.
Horiel she turned north, dodged behind Mt. Sirimau
and cut across the broad base of Latimore Peninsula.
Behind her now lay the Amboina docks and naval
station, the target of bombers that were still on the
way. To the left appeared the tiny villages of Halong
and Lateri, Barry’s landmarks.</p>

<p class='c014'>He hopped over the little rise between them and
found himself above his next objective—between
forty and fifty Jap seaplanes. Nearly half of these
were big three- and four-motored flying boats, <i>Kawanishis</i>
and <i>Mitsubishis</i>. A few <i>Aichi</i> T98’s and a
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>number of single engined <i>Nakajimas</i> made up the
rest.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Burn ’em up, Chick,” Barry Blake ordered
curtly. “Between you and Rourke we ought to account
for plenty of these babies.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The chatter of Chick’s machine gun answered
him. Barry swept over five of the huge <i>Kawanishis</i>,
while Chick Enders and Mickey Rourke ripped at
their engine cowlings, floats and keels. He swung
over a line of little <i>Nakajimas</i>, climbed swiftly, and
came back to strafe a string of <i>Mitsubishi</i> boats.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly a tracer shell streaked past the bomber’s
nose.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look out!” yelped Mickey Rourke. “One of
them bloody <i>Aichi</i> float planes has opened up on
us....”</p>

<p class='c014'>WHANG!</p>

<p class='c014'>A rending explosion in the empty bomb bay punctuated
the little tail gunner’s warning. Barry
banked so sharply that his right wing nearly touched
the water. He hopped over a <i>Kawanishi</i> and kept
the big flying boat between him and the <i>Aichi’s</i>
shells.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If nobody objects,” he remarked drily, “we’re
getting out of here while we’re still in one piece....
Anybody hurt back there?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve got some shrapnel bites in my legs,” Fred
Marmon replied. “How about you, Soapy? That
shell burst right behind us.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>“Are you telling me, Fred?” the radioman returned.
“I won’t be able to sit down in the presence
of my betters for a couple of weeks, anyway. I feel
as if I’d squatted on a red hot stove. When this plane
quits jumping like a bee with St. Vitus’ dance, you’ll
have to look and see what happened to my south
end.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Reassured that neither of his two sergeants was
seriously hurt, Barry cut straight across the Hitu
Peninsula, dodging between the hills. From far behind
came the muffled WHUMP, WHUMP, of
block busters falling on Amboina and the Lata airfield.
There were no Zeros over the hills as yet.
Those which had managed to take off had more
trouble than they could handle in the harbor itself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly a line of white surf stretched across the
Marauder’s course. Skimming low above the waves
she headed for the low fog bank that lay three miles
out from shore. A single shore battery opened fire,
but the shells burst well behind her. Seconds later
she was safe inside the wall of vapor.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How’s the gas, Barry?” Curly Levitt asked. “If
we have to set down before we reach Darwin, I want
to have my island picked out. We might not happen
on a perfect beach like Tana Luva’s, but any land
is better than a rubber raft.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll make it to the mainland, I think,” the
young skipper said, after a glance at the fuel gauge.
“We haven’t a lot to spare, though, after fooling
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>around the harbor with those seaplanes. I’ll go upstairs
and cut the engines down to bare flying speed,
Curly. That ought to save enough gas to bring us
home safely.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Marauder climbed easily now, with no bomb
load and nearly empty fuel tanks. At ten thousand
feet she looked down on a world of rolling clouds
still dyed with sunrise colors. The air at that altitude
was clear and almost windless.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Course is southwest by south,” Curly Levitt’s
voice came over the phone. “As long as we stay
above the ceiling, I can make corrections by shooting
the sun.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good!” Barry answered. “I’m cutting speed to
one hundred fifty m.p.h. We’ll try to hold her there
for the rest of the trip. How are your shell-torn
heroes doing back there in the waist?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Say, Lieutenant,” came Fred Marmon’s reply,
“did you ever try to bandage a man’s seat with a
roll of one-inch gauze? I might do it if Soapy would
hold still, but he’s wiggling like a worm on a fishhook....
Stand still, you jitterbug!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aw, don’t try to be funny!” Soapy’s aggrieved
voice answered. “That iodine you sloshed on me
burns like fire. Just wait till I start operating on
your legs, wise guy!”</p>

<p class='c014'>A chorus of chuckles bubbled over the intercommunication
system. Everyone began ribbing Soapy
and Fred, until the two sergeants were forced to
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>join in the laughter at their expense.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the merriment died down, Mickey Rourke reported
another B-26 bomber overtaking them. It
was flying at top speed, heading for Barry’s plane as
straight as a bullet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hold her steady, Lieutenant,” the little Irishman
warned. “That crackpot pilot is intendin’ to
give us a scare if he can. I wish he wuz a bloody Jap
and I could let him have it—<i>yeow</i>!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The oncoming bomber had dived at the last moment
under Barry’s ship. Her vertical fin had
actually ticked Mickey’s tail position, sending a slight
shock through the whole plane. An instant later she
was nosing ahead, still perilously close to the belly
of the slower flying craft.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look out, Barry!” Chick Enders yelled. “The
crazy galoot is going to zoom right under our nose
... and I’m a dodo if it isn’t <i>Glenn Crayle</i>!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry gritted his teeth as Crayle’s fuselage rose up
just ahead of his greenhouse.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cut the engines, Hap!” he ordered. “I’ll try to
hold our nose up till that fool is clear. If only we
had a trifle more airspeed....”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hap was muttering savagely under his breath.
Chick Enders was gripping his gun, obviously yearning
to pour bullets into Crayle’s back. Abruptly,
however, the little bombardier relaxed. Crayle’s tail
assembly was pulling clear—and Chick had just
caught a glimpse of the rear gunner’s scared face.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>“Slap on the coal, Hap!” Barry cried, as his
plane’s nose tilted sharply upward. “We’re going
into a spin.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The twin engines bellowed. Hap “revved” them
up to the limit, but the spin continued. Instantly
there flashed through Barry’s mind all his instructor
at Randolph had told him to do in such a situation.
His hands and feet now moved automatically, applying
just the right control at the right moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>Four thousand feet above sea level he pulled out
and leveled off on the compass course.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Okay—take over, will you, Hap,” he said, wiping
the sweat from his forehead. “I’m tired out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>His big co-pilot was gazing upward through the
plastic window. Hap’s face was a deep red.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait till that cockeyed ape gets out of sight, can
you, Barry?” he asked in a choked voice. “He’s
stunting now—and waggling his wings at us. If I
took over nothing could keep me from giving him a
dose of his own medicine. I’d probably crash us
both.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Though his face was still damp with perspiration,
Barry smiled.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All right, Hap,” he said quietly. “I’ll give you
a chance to cool off. But you’ve really no reason to
lose your head because Glenn Crayle is a nut. You’re
playing his game when you let him burn you up.
He’s already punished himself, and incidentally his
crew, by using up his gas with that monkey business.
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>If they get home at all it will be on a raft.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Say!” exclaimed Hap, his face brightening. “I
hadn’t thought of that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Apparently Crayle, or someone aboard his plane,
thought of it now for the first time. The stunting
ship straightened out abruptly and headed for home.
Her distance from Barry’s craft, however, remained
unchanged.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He’s reduced speed!” Chick Enders cried. “It’s
too late, though. We’ve still enough to get home,
and he hasn’t. Let’s fly past and give him the merry
<i>ha-ha</i>, Barry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll take over now, Skipper,” Hap chimed in
cheerfully. “It’ll be swell fun pulling up close to his
wing tip and giving him the old ‘thumbs down’
signal.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’re taking the controls but you’re keeping
the interval exactly as it is, fella,” Barry Blake declared.
“Those are my orders. We’re following
Glenn Crayle as far as he goes; and when he sets
down, on land or water, we’ll at least be able to
report his position.”</p>

<p class='c014'>An unhappy silence fell upon the Marauder’s
crew. They knew that their skipper was wholly in
the right and they loved him for it. But their anger
at Crayle was not easily bottled up. The appearance
of a Flying Fortress squadron high overhead furnished
a welcome change of thought.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wish we were going back with them!” Chick
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>Enders exclaimed. “Dropping one egg and skedaddling
like a scared sparrow isn’t my idea of fun. If
we’d come out in <i>Rosy</i>, we could have hung around
Amboina picking our targets and making a real
party of it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s the trouble, Chick,” spoke up Curly Levitt.
“<i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i> had been attending too
many such parties. She’s all shot to junk. I don’t
imagine that squadron of forts will hang around
after they’ve reached their target area. They’ll drop
their loads where they’ll do the most good, and head
for home.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here comes a bunch of Liberators!” cried Hap
Newton. “Oh, boy, are those Japs due for a royal
pasting! They’ll probably send in a few squadrons
of Australian Havocs and North American Mitchells
with regular bomb loads to mop up the shipping
in the main harbor. That place will be a shambles.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hap’s guess was correct. Half an hour later three
large formations of Australian attack bombers and
B-25’s swept over, headed for the Jap base. The soldiers
of Hirohito were going to get their teeth
knocked loose before this day was over!</p>

<p class='c014'>For the next hour Barry watched his fuel gauge as
a mother watches her sick infant. From time to time
he asked Curly to check their position by dead reckoning.
Finally he asked his navigator to shoot the
sun and make an accurate check.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Either there’s a difference between our compass
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>and the one on that other plane,” he said, “or Crayle
is away off course. He could be heading for one of
the Jap-held islands to make his forced landing. In
any case, I want to know exactly where we are.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Curly Levitt stepped up to the top gun turret
with his octant and took his shot. For a few minutes
he figured rapidly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’re right, Skipper,” he said in a shocked tone.
“We’re heading straight toward the Tanimbar
group of islands. If it weren’t for the cloud rug below
us we could probably see them from here.
There’s a good-sized Jap base on the biggest island,
and probably a holding force of soldiers on most of
the little ones. Any Allied plane that lands in this
area is sure to be bombed or captured....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He’s going down!” yelped Hap Newton. “Shall
we follow him, Skipper? There may be a low ceiling
under these clouds.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll take over,” Barry answered. “No telling what
we’ll run into below!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He shoved the bomber’s nose down into the cloud
scuff. Eyes fixed on the altimeter, he held her in a
power dive, past five thousand, four thousand, three
thousand....</p>

<p class='c014'>At two thousand feet they broke through the ceiling
into a thin drizzle of rain. Visibility was fair.
Crayle’s ship was about the same distance ahead as
before, flying low toward a small land mass three
miles away. Beyond the small island loomed the
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>dim bulk of Tanimbar.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry dropped his plane quickly toward the water.
If no Japs on Tanimbar had already spotted
the two bombers, the little island’s mass would hide
them from the larger one. There might still be a
chance to rescue Crayle’s crew. Yes! There was a
smooth, straight beach, now exposed at low tide.</p>

<p class='c014'>Circling just offshore, Barry watched the other
plane land. The tricycle gear touched the hard
packed sand lightly and rolled to a smooth stop.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Neat work!” Barry applauded. “I hope I do as
well. Of course a nearly empty B-26 wouldn’t plow
up wet beach sand like a fortress....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hey! What’s the idea, Skipper?” Hap blurted in
alarm. “You’re not going to maroon us too on that
beach? Isn’t losing one perfectly good plane enough
to suit you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Keep your shirt on, Hap—and everybody!” Barry
replied. “We may have to abandon one plane, but
there’s nothing to stop us from picking up Crayle
and his team and taking them home with us in ours.
I have an idea they’ll jump at the chance, too!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The moment that Barry’s wheels touched the
wave-packed sand, he knew he had made no mistake.
The beach was hard and smooth enough for a take-off.
Best of all, its length at low tide made a runway
as perfect as could be wished.</p>

<p class='c014'>A hundred feet from Crayle’s bomber, Barry
stopped his plane.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Everybody out and swing her around!” he cried,
unfastening his safety belt. “Maybe we won’t have
to take off in a hurry, but we’re going to be prepared.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Glenn Crayle and his six team mates were standing
rather gloomily beside their ship. Evidently
they had been laying full blame for their predicament
on the pilot. Crayle’s sulky, handsome face
was flushed with anger as he glared at the newly
arrived crew.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Couldn’t you find a beach of your own to set
down on?” he snarled. “Or did you just want to be
chummy? If you came to bum gas, you’re out of
luck, Blake. Our tanks are dry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry ignored him. With a pleasant nod of greeting
he spoke to the other crew’s navigator, a blond,
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>worried-looking chap.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We came down to ask if you fellows wanted a
ride home,” he said. “Of course, if you had any gas
left it would help, but I think we still have enough
left to take both crews back to base. What do you
say?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The other’s worried frown vanished.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What can we say, except ‘Thanks?’” he answered
heartily. “It’s pretty swell of you to risk a landing
on this beach just to pick us up.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s right!” the co-pilot agreed. “This island
is enemy territory. You could have just gone on and
reported us forced down here. Why you didn’t do
that, after what happened an hour ago, I can’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Forget it!” smiled Barry Blake. “Help us turn
our plane around, and pile in. We don’t want to
hang around here till some Jap patrol plane finds
us.... Coming, Crayle?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No!” blurted the other pilot furiously. “Tonight
there’ll be a chance to find a Jap boat or plane along
shore and transfer its gas. If none of my crew has
the nerve to take that chance with me, I’ll do it
alone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no answering such a crack-brained
statement. Crayle’s proposition hadn’t one chance
in ten thousand of accomplishment, even with a full
crew to help him. Barry turned away with a shrug.</p>

<p class='c014'>Crayle’s crew followed him. The combined teams
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>lifted the tail of Barry’s plane and walked it around.
Now the bomber was facing in the direction from
which she had come. As Barry Blake stooped to
crawl through the belly hatch, Crayle’s co-pilot, Ted
Landis, halted him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait a minute, Skipper,” he said. “Crayle was
lying when he told you our tanks were dry. We have
nowhere near enough gas to reach Port Darwin,
thanks to his stunting, but if we put it with yours,
we’d all be sure of getting home. Shall we get it
now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry hesitated. What Ted Landis proposed was
common sense. On the other hand, Crayle would
certainly prefer charges of mutiny, assault and everything
else he could contrive if they drained the
tank of his plane against his orders.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All right, Landis,” the young Fortress skipper
decided. “We’ll do that. And we’ll take Crayle
along whether he wants to come or not. We can all
testify that he is not behaving like a sane man.
Drain off that gas, Mister, and let’s get away from
here the minute it’s transferred to our tanks.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The crew of the stranded bomber hurried back to
it at Landis’ heels. Ignoring Crayle, the co-pilot and
his engineer dived into the open hatch. The others
stood beside it, blocking their furious skipper’s way.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll have you all court-martialed!” Crayle
shouted, completely beside himself. “Stand away
from that hatch—”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>“Look out!” yelled a member of his crew. “Here
come the Japs—they’re on to us!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The droning of airplane engines swelled to a
snarling roar. Over the treetops came a twin-engined
<i>Mitsubishi</i> bomber, but she was not heading
toward the two B-26’s. Evidently she had just
taken off from Tanimbar on patrol, with no idea
that enemy planes were so near. Her Jap crewmen
were probably more surprised than the Americans.
Swerving, she opened fire with her bow and belly
weapons as she started her climb.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Man those guns!” yelped Crayle. “That Jap will
be back for us. Inside with you!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Without a second’s hesitation the team obeyed. A
moment before they had defied his orders, but this
was different. In a fight they’d stand by their skipper,
crazy or not.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry’s team was already inside. His Marauder’s
engines bellowed. Like a startled seagull she swept
down the long, straight beach. As Barry lifted her
into the air he saw the Mitsubishi coming back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good grief!” he gasped. “She’s going over
Crayle’s plane at a thousand feet.... She’s going to
<i>bomb</i> as well as strafe it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Climbing as he turned, he was still too far from
the Jap for his .50-calibers to take effect. In a matter
of seconds the <i>Mitsubishi</i> would drop her bomb at
point blank range. The stranded Marauder’s crew
wouldn’t have a chance!</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>Evidently one member of Crayle’s team had realized
this and decided to save his own skin. He was
running for dear life toward the jungle. As tracer
bullets began streaking past him he flung himself
flat.</p>

<p class='c014'>Leaning hard on the controls, Barry fairly
whipped his plane around. Already Chick Enders
was firing his bow gun. The two weapons in the
top turret were raving.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Riddle the Jap!” Barry shouted. “Don’t let him
drop that egg—Oh-h-h!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The slender, deadly shape of a falling bomb had
caught his eye. To the agonized nerves of the
watchers its descent seemed as slow as a falling leaf’s.
Deliberately its pointed end dipped downward, aiming
straight at Crayle’s doomed plane.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry did not wait for the explosion. With his
jaw set like a rock, he headed his B-26 for the enemy.
The bomb’s blast barely jolted the air about him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Catch the Nip before he loses himself in the
clouds!” Chick Enders muttered, reaching for a new
belt of ammunition. “He’s trying to run from us,
and that’s his only chance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He won’t make it, Chick,” Barry replied
through clenched teeth. “We’re more than a hundred
miles faster.... You boys in the turret—start
ripping that <i>Mitsu’s</i> belly. <i>Now!</i>”</p>

<p class='c014'>The turret guns chattered. A second later, Chick’s
bow gun joined them. The Marauder was overtaking
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>her enemy as if he were anchored.</p>

<p class='c014'>Smoke burst from the Jap’s fuselage. Flame licked
at his left engine. He staggered like a wing-shot
goose under the slashing American fire. His guns
were still talking back, but their aim was nervous
and poor.</p>

<p class='c014'>All at once a great ball of flame appeared just behind
the Jap’s wings, and his nose dropped seaward.
Swathed in fire, he plummeted into the water.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry banked sharply, turning back toward the
island. The bombed B-26 was blazing on the beach.
At the jungle’s edge a lone figure lay motionless.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They’re all dead, Skipper,” Hap Newton muttered.
“Let’s go home before the Nips send out a
flock of Zeros to shoot us up....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait!” Barry Blake exclaimed sharply. “That
bird on the beach isn’t dead yet. I saw him move.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry swung away in a big circle and came in toward
the end of the beach. The others of his team
realized what he intended; he was going to land, regardless
of risk, to save the neck of a coward who had
deserted his fighting crew-mates. At best it meant
that they all would fail to reach Port Darwin on the
gas that would be left. At worst, the Zeros from
Tanimbar would catch and strafe them on the
beach.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet not a man questioned their skipper’s decision.
Each one was ready to back up Barry’s judgment
with his life. The crew of <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i>
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>would remain a smoothly functioning unit as long
as it existed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry’s second landing was as careful as his first.
Rolling as near to the burning bomber as he dared,
he set the brakes, and followed Hap Newton through
the hatch. The man they had come to rescue was
sitting up about fifty yards away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s Crayle, the yellow pup!” Hap grated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It <i>would</i> be!” Chick bitterly exclaimed. “I always
knew a hot pilot of his stripe would be a quitter
when the real test came.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake said nothing as he helped his crew
turn the plane around for a quick take-off. He was
wondering whether Crayle’s dazed manner was real
or faked. A trickle of blood from the pilot’s forehead
suggested a head wound. The man was mumbling
unintelligibly when they reached him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry’s fingers quickly explored the gash in the
injured man’s scalp. Crayle winced but voiced no
protest. The wound, Barry found, was no more
than a shallow cut. Nowhere else on Crayle’s clothing
did he see any sign of blood.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Shell-shocked,” was the young skipper’s verdict.
“His mind has snapped, fellows. Maybe he’ll get
over it shortly, but just now we’ll have to treat him
like a baby. Help me carry him back to the plane,
Hap.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let me, Skipper!” Fred Marmon said, taking
Barry’s place. “I’ve been feeling useless ever since
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>that <i>Mitsubishi</i> torched down.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Despite their awkward burden, they broke into a
run, conscious that any second might bring the
snarling of Zero engines overhead, and a hail of
tracer bullets. Barry, first into the belly hatch,
turned to lift Crayle’s shoulders through the low
door. Mickey Rourke, the last man, glanced up before
ducking inside.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here they come, sir!” he cried, as he dived
through the opening. “Five Zeros, flying low from
Tanimbar.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The bomber’s engine pulled her down the runway
like a scared shadow. Her guns were spitting before
she was in the air. One Jap exploded above her, and
the others scattered briefly. As the B-26 climbed,
they came in from all angles, stabbing at her with
their tracers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again and again Barry’s plane was needled by bullets.
Twice she received shell hits as she roared up
toward the sheltering cloud ceiling. A second Zero
fell away with his engine smoking. Then a shell hit
Mickey Rourke’s tail gun.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry heard the little Irishman’s yell over the intercom,
and guessed its meaning. He zoomed sharply—the
last thing that the pursuing Jap expected. Fred
Marmon’s gun blasted the Nip plane an instant before
the B-26 plunged into the clouds.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll just stay here for a while,” Barry declared.
“The Jap bullets missed my instrument panel. We
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>can fly in any direction we choose as long as our gas
lasts. What’s your suggestion, Curly?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait till I glance at my chart,” replied the navigator.
“There’s a mass of little islands at the southwest
of us—part of the Babar group. We might set
down there unobserved, especially if the ceiling is
low. Of course, we’ll take big chances on finding a
place to land.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A moment later he gave the compass course. Barry,
who was flying due southwest, made the necessary
correction.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How far is the island we’re aiming at?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“About a hundred miles,” Curly told him. “It’s
not one island, but a nest of little ones. The Japs
are less likely to have them guarded.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good reasoning,” Barry commented. “I’m flying
at a steady two hundred m.p.h. Figure out just
when we’ll be six or eight miles from the nearest
island, and let me know. I’m setting down on the
water. If this crate fills and sinks too quickly, we’ll
drown with her, but it’s worth the risk. We’ll probably
be able to reach our rubber boats. In that case
we can keep out of sight of Jap shore patrols until
dark, and then paddle to land.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Skipper,” said Hap Newton solemnly, “I wish I
had half of your brains. In your place, I’d probably
have tried to land. Of course, the Japs would spot
the plane sooner or later, and the hunt would be on.
This way we’ll have a swell chance of foxing them.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>“We’ll still be three hundred miles from Port
Darwin,” Chick Enders spoke up. “Maybe we can
swipe a Jap motor launch some night—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t be so modest,” Hap broke in. “Why not a
plane while we’re about it? I’d rather take a chance
of getting shot down by our own fighters than be
potted like a sitting duck on the water by Jap Zeros.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hold it down, fellows!” Barry Blake ordered
brusquely. “We’re hitting the pond in a very few
minutes. Get out of your parachute harness, and
grab a brace. Fred, you and Soapy Babbitt loosen the
topside hatch so it won’t jam when we come down.
Mickey Rourke will come forward so he won’t be
trapped in the tail if things go wrong. Hap, stand
by those levers that spring the rubber rafts. Curly,
the minute you give the signal, we’ll cut the engines
and nose down.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There were no more wisecracks. Barry’s crew
obeyed orders without wasting a motion, and waited
quietly for the next development. Only Hap Newton
spoke during those last minutes of flight.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll take care of Crayle, Skipper,” he said. “He’ll
be easy to handle, dazed as he is. I’ll inflate his lifejacket
and boost him through the hatch.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ready, Skipper,” Curly’s warning came a few moments
later. “Time to go downstairs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hap Newton cut the throttles. As the engines’
roar died out the plane’s nose dipped seaward. When
they broke through the low ceiling the water rolled
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>barely a thousand feet beneath.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ocean, Barry noted with thankfulness, was
calm, except for a long, smooth ground swell. He
must time his landing so as to set his ship down in
the middle of a watery valley. Thus he could kill
her forward motion against the waning slope of the
swell ahead, and the shell-torn bomber might float
for a good many seconds. If he should miscalculate
and strike a crest, his plane would dive like a fish.</p>

<p class='c014'>One glance only he spared for the island that lay
nearest, a full six miles away. It was tiny—little larger
than a city park. The Japs might have posted a guard
or two on it, but at this distance they could easily
fail to notice a bomber landing on the water with a
dead stick.</p>

<p class='c014'>The long, oily swells now swept along barely a
hundred feet below him. Barry picked the valley
where he must try to set down.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is it, fellows!” he warned.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every man in the plane except Crayle held his
breath. The next seconds seemed age-long. Then
came the shock.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fixtures flew from the bulkhead above the radio
panel. Green water poured in through the shell holes
in the bomb bay. It roused the half-stunned men to
desperate action.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hap Newton had already sprung the rubber life
rafts. These were now floating on either side of the
plane, attached to it by light lines. Soapy Babbitt
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>and Fred Marmon were first through the topside
hatch, by Barry’s orders. Next came Mickey Rourke,
the little tail gunner. Before climbing out, Mickey
tossed a queer-looking bundle to the men outside. It
was a long, oilskin covered parcel wrapped in a Mae
West lifejacket.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t let it get away from yez,” he grunted, as he
pulled himself up. “That bundle may be worth the
lives of all of us before we’re through.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Chick Enders was the fourth man out, Curly Levitt
the fifth. They crouched on the slippery, rolling
fuselage, and reached down to take Crayle’s limp
weight from Hap Newton and Barry.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hurry, you two!” Chick shouted. “This crate’s
sinking fast.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Salt water was already three feet deep in the cockpit,
as Barry turned sharply on his co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Up with you, Mister!” he snapped. “I’m last!”</p>

<p class='c014'>For the first and only time, Hap Newton was guilty
of an act of mutiny. He seized Barry in a gorilla-like
grip and literally hurled him through the opening
overhead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’re worth three of me, Skipper,” he panted,
“in everything but pounds!”</p>

<p class='c014'>On top of the waterlogged plane, Barry twisted
himself around like a cat, to face the hatch. Hap’s
head and shoulders were over the edge as the bomber’s
nose dipped suddenly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Quick, you idiot!” the young skipper cried. “She’s
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>going under! What’s holding you, Hap!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My feet!” the co-pilot gasped. “They’re tangled
in a parachute harness or something. Don’t wait for
me, Skipper!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry grabbed the bigger man beneath the arms.
His feet found a purchase on the hatch combing.
With every muscle of his body straining, he added
his strength to Hap Newton’s.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now,” the thought wrenched at his brain, “something’s
<i>got</i> to give way!”</p>

<p class='c014'>It did. Like a cork from a bottle Hap’s big body
popped out of the hatch. Both men went under
water. Breathless, stroking for dear life, they fought
to reach the surface. The water seemed like a living
enemy, clutching them, pulling them down. Their
lungs were on fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>They broke surface together, gasping, not far from
one of the rafts. Fred Marmon’s whoop of joy
blended with the splash of paddles.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The plane—where’d it go?” Hap Newton gulped.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To Davy Jones’s locker!” Fred answered as he
reached past Crayle to grasp the co-pilot’s hand. “We
thought it had sucked you and the Skipper down
with it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Chick Enders and Curly Levitt pulled Barry onto
their raft.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Great guns, Skipper!” the little bombardier exclaimed.
“I never was so glad to see anything as I was
to spot your headgear poking up out of that swell!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Chick cut our line just in time,” Curly remarked,
“or the ship’s plunge would have spilled us into the
pond, too. And, speaking of water, I hope we find
a spring on that island when we reach it tonight.
Nobody ever thought to bring along anything to
drink, unless Mickey Rourke has a canteen in that
bundle of his.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have not!” the little gunner retorted. “Many a
flier has been set adrift without water and lived to
tell the tale. The small matter of a drink did not
worry me. But the night before we took off from the
flat-top I had a dream of floatin’ helpless on a rubber
doughnut while the bloody Japs strafed me from the
air. So I brought along a waterproofed tommy-gun,
just in case me dream came true! Ye can laugh at
me if yez feel like it, gintlemen.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who wants to laugh?” Curly Levitt cried. “After
this I’ll trade all my day dreams for one of your
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>nightmares, Mickey.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’re the nitwits not to think of something like
that!” Barry Blake confessed. “Did you by any
chance remember to put some oil and cotton waste
in the same package? Our pistols could stand a
cleaning now, before the salt water makes them useless.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Rourke pulled the little oilskin-wrapped container
from his bundle and handed it to Barry.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here it is, sir,” he said with a grin. “I’m sorry
I’m not a real sleight-of-hand artist, so I could produce
a glass of ice water just as easy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry’s left eyelid flickered in a mysterious wink.
Pulling out his water-soaked automatic, he handed
it, butt first, to the little sergeant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You clean my gun for me, Mickey, and I’ll produce
your glass of drinking water—though it may be
minus the ice. I’m afraid neither a silk hat nor a
rabbit was included in this raft’s equipment, but we
have something just as good.”</p>

<p class='c014'>While the others watched, open mouthed, Barry
turned to a small, waterproofed case attached to the
side of the raft. Opening it he drew out an object
that looked like a small alcohol stove built on futuristic
lines.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here’s our water supply,” he said, holding it up.
“You put seawater in <i>there</i> and a little can of fuel in
<i>here</i> and set the thing going with a match. In an
hour we’ll have a quart and a pint of pure, distilled
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>water. Hap Newton has a gadget just like this on his
raft.... What do you think of it, Hap?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s the only respectable still I ever saw,” the irrepressible
co-pilot answered. “How much ‘Adam’s
Ale’ will it turn out before all the fuel’s used up?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“About fifteen pounds,” Barry stated. “One of the
officers on the carrier told me each plane’s rafts were
equipped with it. I just forgot to pass on the news.
This still is a piece of regular Navy equipment, and
so is the fishing tackle that goes with it.... Look!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Reaching into the case again he brought out a
sealed, three-pound can. Under the amazed eyes of
his three companions, he opened it to show a complete
fishing outfit of hooks, lines and dried bait.
There was even a small steel spearhead for gaffing
large fish.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll use this right away,” the young skipper
declared. “Since we’re so near to land we can afford
to use some of our still’s fuel to broil a tasty fish
dinner. Here are three hook-and-line rigs, so it
shouldn’t take us long to catch a meal.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The castaways discovered all at once that they were
ravenously hungry. With the tension of immediate
danger gone, they went at the fishing with the zest of
youngsters. The fish were hungry, too. Within half
an hour fifteen pounds of finny food lay on the bottom
of the two rafts.</p>

<p class='c014'>The difficult job was preparing and cooking them.
Barry solved the problem by cutting the fish into
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>fillets and broiling these on the blade of one of the
raft’s aluminum oars. Two cans of fuel were used
for that one meal.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We couldn’t be so wasteful, out of sight of land,”
Curly Levitt observed. “We’d have to learn to eat
our fish raw and like it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Which might not be so hard, after all, sir,”
Mickey Rourke responded. “A sailor once told me
he’d drifted for three weeks on a big raft with six
other lads, and eaten raw fish three times a day. They
cut it thin and dried it in the sun, like herring. The
sea water had salted it already. Me friend said it
tasted fine.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your sailor friend was spinning you a salty yarn,
if you ask me,” said Chick. “What did he do when
the water rations gave out?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sure, that was easy!” Mickey Rourke replied.
“He drank fish with his meals and was never thirsty
except when it stormed for three days and the fish
wouldn’t bite—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Haw, haw, haw!” howled Hap Newton, whose
raft had drifted closer. “You bit, all right, Chick.
You ought to know better than to match wits with
an Irishman. So they <i>drank</i> more fish when they got
thirsty, huh! That’s the best joke I’ve heard since I
was a dodo. How about it, Barry?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake’s smile was not sympathetic.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The joke’s on you, Hap!” he chuckled. “Mickey,
hand me that fish we didn’t cook, and I’ll show Lieutenant
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>Newton just what sort of a sucker he is to
doubt your word.”</p>

<p class='c014'>From the bottom of the bait can Barry took a
folded square of muslin and the sharp edged spearhead.
After making criss-cross cuts through each side
of the five pound fish, he pulled the diced flesh from
the bones and placed them in the cloth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now hold the can under this muslin while we
wring out a fresh fish cocktail, Mickey,” he directed.</p>

<p class='c014'>From the cloth, strongly twisted by Barry and the
little sergeant, a stream of watery liquid dribbled
into the bait can. When no more would come, Barry
threw out the squeezed fish meat and put in more
diced pieces. The final result was half a cupful of
fish juice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s drinkable,” the young skipper declared after
the first taste, “just as that naval officer on the flat-top
told me it would be. There’s practically no salt taste,
and it’s not as strong of fish as you’d imagine. Who
wants to hint that Sergeant Mickey Rourke is a liar,
now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hap Newton shook his head solemnly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I take it all back, gentlemen,” he said. “I’ll never
doubt your word again, Mickey, unless I see you
wink behind my back. But please don’t ask me to
guzzle your fish cocktail while I have a perfectly good
still to make my own moonshine water. Pass me a
match, Fred, and let’s get the thing started. I want
to wet my whistle before Crayle, here, wakes up and
demands a fresh water bath.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>While their water stills boiled, the two raft crews
began paddling toward the island. Their progress
was less than a mile an hour, but that did not bother
them. With darkness still several hours away, they
dared not approach too near.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The moon rises early tonight,” Curly Levitt informed
his friends. “If we’re within two miles of
land then, we should be able to see the shore line.
The cloud ceiling isn’t so thick that it will shut out
all the light.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As a matter of fact, the clouds thinned as evening
approached. A stiff breeze sprang up, drifting the
rafts so rapidly toward land that the paddles were
no longer needed. As the last daylight faded a faint
glow above the eastern horizon told that the moon
was up.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rafts had been tied together all afternoon, to
avoid drifting too far apart. Now, with paddles plying
steadily, they were making good headway toward
the dark line of jungle that marked the island. Barry
Blake, in the leading “doughnut,” strained his ears
for any sound of breakers that would indicate a dangerous
landing place. There was none—only the
rhythmical roaring of the surf on the smooth beach,
and the slap-slap-slap of water against the rafts’ flat
bottoms.</p>

<p class='c014'>They were a hundred yards from the head of a
little cove when the clouds thinned enough to show
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>the moon. For five short seconds the light was fairly
clear. A scudding cloud mass dimmed it, but not
before Barry had glimpsed a long, black shape moving
out from shore.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stop paddling!” the young skipper whispered.
“Pass the word to Hap’s raft.... There’s a boat
putting out from the beach—due to pass us within a
few yards. Have your guns ready if it spots us, and
keep your heads down.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sure, I knew me little tommy-gun would come
in handy, Lieutenant,” Mickey Rourke muttered.
“I’ll take the oilskin bag off and be ready when yez
say, ‘Open fire!’”</p>

<p class='c014'>Tense moments passed. A patch of darkness
blacker than the surrounding water moved into Barry’s
range of vision. Mickey had seen it, too. He
snuggled lower in the raft, the stock of his weapon
tight against his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c014'>Abruptly a high-pitched, chattering voice broke
out in the oncoming boat. Barry felt Sergeant
Rourke stiffen beside him, waiting the word to fire.
But that word was never given. A girl’s voice spoke
from the darkness in clear American.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Quiet, Nanu!” it said. “That’s not a Jap boat,
unless it’s upside down. Paddle closer and we’ll look
the thing over.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Gusty sighs of relief went up from the bomber’s
crew.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A girl! From the States!” they chorused.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>“So they want to look us over,” remarked Fred
Marmon’s voice sententiously. “Well, <i>I’m a monkey’s
uncle</i>!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Feminine laughter pealed in the darkness. There
were two women in the strange boat and at least one
white man, to judge by the voices. Barry thought,
however, that he could distinguish other figures.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’re the crew of an American bomber, forced
down by lack of fuel this afternoon,” he explained.
“We nearly turned a sub-machine gun on you people
a minute ago, thinking you were Japs. If we hadn’t
heard one of the ladies speak—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That was Dora Wilcox,” another girl broke in.
“She and her father had a mission station here; and
I’d just come out to join my father at his cocoanut
plantation when the Japs came. We’ve been hiding
from them ever since. The little brutes caught and
killed Reverend Wilcox only last week. I’m Claire
Barrows, and my father is here beside me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We had a hard time persuading Miss Wilcox to
come with us,” a man’s voice added. “She wanted
to stay with the native converts until they themselves
urged her to leave. The Japs are due to occupy this
island in force at any time.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nanu and Kari Luva and their wives decided to
escape with us in their catamaran,” Dora Wilcox
chimed in. “Why don’t you people join us? This
craft is really too heavy for three men and four
women to paddle, and we’re well stocked with water
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>and food. I’m sure that Providence brought us together—and
kept you from shooting us in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no resisting the girl’s logic. Barry Blake
quickly introduced his crew by name as they lifted
Crayle into the native boat. He himself came aboard
last, carrying his precious still and fishing tackle. The
two rubber rafts were left to float ashore and mystify
any Jap patrol that might find them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dora Wilcox, he soon discovered, was the real
leader of the refugees. The four natives showed a
childlike devotion to her. Even Clarke Barrows, the
middle-aged plantation owner, deferred to the girl’s
opinion. Barry Blake found himself consumed with
curiosity to see the face of this young person who
planned like a general and thought of everybody else
before herself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dora Wilcox’s hope was to sail the entire three
hundred miles to Australia. She had brought palm
fiber mats to cover the catamaran during the day
and make it appear abandoned. The mats would
serve the double purpose of camouflage and shade.
At night the sail would be raised. With a favorable
wind, she told Barry, the double-dugout craft could
travel as much as eighty miles between dusk and
dawn.</p>

<p class='c014'>The young Fortress skipper glanced up at the
scudding clouds. Weather, he realized, would have
a great deal to do with the success or failure of their
escape. Without a keel the catamaran would make
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>a lot of leeway. If the wind held from the northeast,
it could easily blow them ashore on a Jap occupied
island. The wisest plan would be to get as far to
windward as they could before dawn.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let us take the paddles, Miss Wilcox,” he said.
“My crew will relieve your native boys until it’s time
to hoist sail. Then perhaps we can figure out a way
to beat the leeward drift.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’re at your orders from now on, Lieutenant,”
the girl replied. “None of us is a navigator. If an
American bomber crew can’t take us through, no human
power could do it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The seven airmen fell to work with a will and a
weight of muscle that sent the thirty-foot boat lightly
over the swells. At midnight, when the sky cleared,
they were well out of sight of land. Now for the first
time the bomber team had a chance to see their companions’
faces.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the moonlight neither of the white girls looked
more than eighteen or twenty years old. Claire Barrows
had her father’s wide mouth and turned-up
nose, and a smile that was decidedly attractive. Dora
smiled less often, and her features were more finely
chiseled. She wore her long hair in braids wound
about her head. Her calm, efficient, thoughtful personality
could be read at a glance. Somehow she
made Barry’s pulse beat faster than any girl had
done before.</p>

<p class='c014'>The two native couples were quite young, in their
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>’teens or early twenties. As they sat relaxed, balancing
with the boat’s dip and sway, their shapely black
bodies would have thrilled any sculptor. Barry could
imagine what capture by the Japs would mean to
these children of nature—slavery, degradation, living
death!</p>

<p class='c014'>The thought made him fiercely determined to outwit
the enemy, to bring all these people through the
gantlet of Jap boats, planes, and shore patrols.
Thirteen persons now depended largely on him as
their skipper. He must find some means of covering
those three hundred miles to Australia in a shorter
time.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have it!” he exclaimed aloud. “We’ll use the
paddles in place of a centerboard. Is there any rope
handy, Dora?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Plenty,” replied the girl. “But what do you mean
by using paddles for a centerboard, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll show you,” the young skipper smiled, looking
straight into her eyes. “But please leave off the
handle and call me Barry, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“All right,” Dora Wilcox answered, with a twinkle
in her eyes. “It’s easier to say.... Oh, Nanu! Hand
me that coil of rope you’re sitting on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With the help of his crew, Barry tied four of the
native paddles at intervals between the catamaran’s
twin floats. The broad wooden blades, thrust deep
in the water, acted like a keel. Now the wind pushing
on the sail would not drift the craft sidewise. Already
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>equipped with a steering oar, the awkward-looking
boat was now as manageable as a catboat.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the single, lanteen-type sail went up, water
boiled white under the double bow. The catamaran
was gathering speed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Splendid!” cried Claire Barrows. “All we need
now is a chart and a compass to set the course. Which
way is Port Darwin, anyway, Lieutenant Newton?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll be just plain ‘Hap’ to you, if you want me to
live up to my nickname,” the big co-pilot retorted.
“When it comes to finding directions, Curly Levitt
is the lad to consult. He carries a compass in his
head, I think!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have one in my pocket, which is a lot better,”
Curly spoke up. “And I stuffed a chart of these islands
under my shirt when the plane was forced
down. With that equipment I can keep track of our
course by dead reckoning. It will be pretty crude,
without a log to check the knots we’re making, but
at least we won’t miss the broadside of Australia!”</p>

    <div>FLOATING WRECKAGE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For the rest of the night, most of the catamaran’s
company dozed or slept. The craft was amazingly
steady for its size. Although low to the water, she was
not particularly “wet.” The raised central platform
on which her crew sat or sprawled caught only a
feather of spray from time to time. The four natives
slept as soundly as if they were on shore.</p>

<p class='c014'>At dawn the breeze freshened. For three hours the
catamaran skipped southward over the long rollers,
while everyone kept a sharp lookout for planes. Fiber
mats were lashed in place to afford the greatest
possible shade. Barry noticed with amazement how
cleverly Dora Wilcox had painted their top surfaces
to look like wreckage to a passing plane. Only the
sail and the greenish wake behind could tell a Jap
pilot that there was life on the crazy-looking craft.
At first sight of a plane, Barry planned to drop the
sail, and trust that the fading wake would not be
noticed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Every mile that we cover lessens our danger,” he
declared, “and every unnecessary hour we spend in
enemy waters increases it. I think it’s worth the risk
to keep moving—especially in perfect sailing weather
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>like this.”</p>

<p class='c014'>His companions agreed. There was risk, whichever
way they turned, and to know that every hour
cut their distance from the continent by eight or nine
more miles was a great boost to their morale.</p>

<p class='c014'>At noon the wind had slackened. The catamaran
was making barely five knots, Curly judged. The
sky was like a vast, blue furnace, without a speck of
cloud. Had it not been for the straw mats, the white
members of the company would have been painfully
sunburned. The four natives were elected to keep
watch for planes, as their eyes and their skins were
better able to stand intense sunlight.</p>

<p class='c014'>The watchers may not have been to blame for failing
to see the Jap seaplane in time. He had probably
come gliding out of the sun, invisible and silent.
The roar of his motor and the snarling of his machine
guns, as he suddenly power-dived, were the
Americans’ first warning.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thirty-caliber bullets peppered the catamaran. A
few pierced the camouflage matting. Three or four,
by some freak, chewed the mast half through at a
point four feet above the decking. One struck the
leg of Nanu, the steersman. The rest of the little
slugs struck the log hulls or missed entirely.</p>

<p class='c014'>Glenn Crayle, who had remained until now in a
shell-shocked stupor, came to life with a howl. A bullet
had grazed his shin. He moaned for help, but nobody
paid any attention. Barry Blake’s quick, sharp
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>orders averted the panic that otherwise might have
cost them all their lives.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lie low, everybody. Whatever happens, don’t
disturb the mats. Mickey Rourke, crawl outside with
your tommy-gun and pretend to be wounded. Send
the native women in under cover. That Jap will be
back in two shakes to look us over. If he flies low
enough to make sure of your hitting him, let him
have it.... Otherwise hold your fire.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Claire Barrows began weeping hysterically.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll all be k-killed,” she sobbed. “Like rats in
a c-cage. I’m g-going to jump overboard and—”</p>

<p class='c014'>SMACK!</p>

<p class='c014'>Dora Wilcox slapped her friend hard across the
mouth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stop it, Claire, this instant!” she commanded. “A
fine example you’re setting Alua and Lehu. For
shame!”</p>

<p class='c014'>As Claire’s sobs quieted, Mickey’s voice reached
the others from outside the shelter of mats.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Jap is comin’ in low to see what he did to
us,” the little sergeant reported. “I’ll play dead till
the last second, and then pour it into him. He’s a
<i>Nakajima</i> single-engine job, equipped with floats.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The hum of the Jap’s motor grew louder. Once
more his machine guns opened up, but this time his
burst was high enough to miss the catamaran’s crew.
It finished the mast which fell across the matting,
scaring the women but doing no damage.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>As the plane roared low overhead, Mickey
Rourke’s gun opened up. Its harsh, deadly chatter
held the hopes of fourteen souls. It ceased, and the
Jap’s engine song rose sharply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hit him!” came Mickey’s whoop. “He’s zoomin’....
He’s goin’ into a stall.... His engine’s
smokin’ and he’s goin’ to crash!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Without waiting for more, the catamaran’s company
threw aside the concealing mats. They were
just in time to see the <i>Nakajima</i> end her tail-spin in
a great splash and a burst of flame, less than two hundred
yards away.</p>

<p class='c014'>The fight was over. Except for a patch of burning
oil on the water, and the three wounded persons on
the sailing craft, it would have been hard to realize
that the thing had not been a nightmare.</p>

<p class='c014'>“’Twas just as I saw it in me dream,” Mickey
Rourke was saying. “The only part I didn’t see was
Nanu and Miss Wilcox bein’ wounded—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What’s that?” Barry cut in. “You wounded,
Dora? Let me see what’s under that cloth!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The girl shook her head. Her face was pale, but
the hand with which she pressed a folded towel to her
left arm was perfectly steady.</p>

<p class='c014'>“See to Nanu first,” she replied. “Hurry—or I’ll
do it myself. He’s lost too much blood already.
You’ll find clean cloths here in my little chest.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry flung open the cover of the teakwood box
she indicated. Inside, packed neatly with a few feminine
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>belongings, were a number of old, clean cloths.
Barry snatched out a threadbare pillowcase and a
man’s ragged white shirtsleeve. With these, he made
his way to Nanu who sat in the stern with his hands
clasped around his thigh.</p>

<p class='c014'>The native boy’s wound was a clean puncture.
The small-caliber, steel-jacketed bullet had passed
through his thigh muscles just above the knee. Fortunately
it had missed the larger artery and the blood
had already begun to clot. Barry applied a cloth pad
to each bullet hole, binding them tightly in place
with strips of the old pillowcase. Throughout the
operation, Nanu lay quiet. When Barry slapped him
on the shoulder and told him, “Everything’s okay!”
the boy’s eyes had lost all trace of fright.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meanwhile, Claire and Hap were dressing Dora’s
hurt. A bullet had gouged her forearm, making a
painful but not a crippling wound. Claire showed
considerable skill in the bandaging. She had brought
her nerves fully under control, and was giving sharp
orders to Hap.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry glanced at the splintered mast and fallen
sail. Before much progress could be made, it was
evident that the catamaran would have to land for
repairs. At present it looked so thoroughly wrecked
that the most suspicious Jap patrol pilot would
hardly waste bullets on it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The same thoughts were evidently in Curly Levitt’s
mind. Standing up beside his skipper, he
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>pointed to a fairly large island, seven or eight miles
to leeward.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We can go ashore there tonight, Barry,” he said.
“With the sail hanging on the stump of the mast as
it is now, we’ll drift toward that island at the rate
of about one knot per hour. Everybody can keep out
of sight under the mats and wreckage. We’ll tie
the steering oar in place and let the wind do the
rest....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No!” Glenn Crayle’s shout interrupted him.
“You’re foolish to go any nearer to land. The Japs
will bomb us. They’ll shoot us down like dogs.
You’ve got paddles, haven’t you? Start using them,
then, if you’re not too lazy! I forbid you to head for
shore, Blake!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He’s crazy as a loon,” Curly muttered. “How are
we going to shut him up, Barry?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young skipper made his way forward to where
Crayle sat binding a handkerchief around his grazed
shin. He took a firm grip on the shell-shocked pilot’s
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look there, Crayle,” he said, pointing to a black
triangular fin that showed above the oncoming wave.
“That shark is hungry. He smells blood. He’ll probably
trail this boat till it lands—unless one of us falls
overboard. Be quiet and behave yourself, or <i>you’ll
be that one</i>!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Crayle’s mouth fell open. In sudden terror he
gazed at the approaching shark.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>“No! No!” he moaned, clutching Barry’s arm.</p>

<p class='c014'>The young skipper freed himself with a grimace
of disgust.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Everybody under the mats!” he ordered.
“There’s no telling when the next Jap plane will
show up. Once we’re out of sight we can relax and
eat a bit of lunch, if the ladies care to break into their
supplies now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Cocoanuts, bananas, smoked chicken and taro
bread had been stored in the catamaran’s hollow
hulls—enough to last the entire company for a week.
Since it was the first meal the bomber’s crew had
tasted for a whole day, they were given extra rations.</p>

<p class='c014'>Crayle wolfed down his share and reached for
more. A sharp word from Barry stopped him, but
the young skipper caught a look of animal cunning
that replaced the greed in the other’s eyes. From
now on, Barry decided, the shock-crazed lieutenant
would need to be watched like a wild beast. There
was no predicting what mad impulse might seize his
twisted brain.</p>

<p class='c014'>They were finishing their meal when another Jap
plane roared overhead. This was a twin-engined
<i>Mitsubishi</i> bomber, a land-based type, that appeared
to have taken off from the island to leeward. It
swooped low to investigate the drifting catamaran.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a tense thirty seconds Barry’s party waited, and
wondered if more bullets would come slashing
through their thin fiber mats. Then the engines’
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>snarl faded to a distant droning. Their camouflage
had worked!</p>

<p class='c014'>Not so pleasant was the thought that they would
have to land on a beach patrolled by the enemy. If
this island were the site of a Jap air base it would
be well guarded. Even the darkness might not be
camouflage enough to fool the Nip patrols.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the afternoon waned, the island’s shore line
grew more and more distinct. A second bomber rose
from behind the wall of dark green jungle, and three
more returned from some patrol or bombing mission.
There could be no doubt of the existence of
an air base somewhere inland from the beach.</p>

<p class='c014'>The one encouraging fact was that none of the
planes paid any particular attention to the drifting
catamaran. Undoubtedly they had all looked it over.
If the wreck looked so harmless to the Jap pilots,
shore patrols were not likely to bother their heads
about it. The real danger would come after Barry’s
crew went ashore to cut a new mast.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sun was low in the west when two squadrons
of heavy bombers approached at 20,000 feet. Even
before the Jap ack-ack on the island cut loose, Barry’s
party recognized them—<i>American Flying Fortresses
and Liberators</i>!</p>

<p class='c014'>Peering up through the cracks in the camouflage,
everyone aboard the catamaran raised a wild cheer.
For a moment, Barry had all he could do to keep his
crew from tossing the fiber mats aside and standing
up to wave. His orders were drowned out by the
thunder of exploding bombs.</p>

<div id='fig13'  class='figcenter id017'>

<p><i>Peering Through the Camouflage They All Cheered</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>The noise, even at a distance of three miles, was
ear-shattering. The very ocean shuddered. More
than eighty tons of block-busters, Barry later calculated,
must have been dropped within the space of a
few minutes on the Jap air base.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the two squadrons re-formed and wheeled
majestically away into the evening sky, not a single
shellburst followed them. The Jap antiaircraft was
wiped out. Instead of ack-ack a vast pillar of smoke
and flame mushroomed up from the smitten jungle.</p>

<p class='c014'>For some moments afterward no word was spoken
aboard the drifting boat. That swift, devastating
raid had left the watchers awed, and a little dazed.
Chick Enders was the first to break silence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So,” he exclaimed hoarsely, “that’s the way a
real air-blitz sounds and looks from below! The next
time I’m laying big eggs on Hirohito’s little boys, I’ll
know better what I’m dishing out to them!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Most of the crew wanted to paddle ashore immediately,
but Barry restrained them. Unless the Jap
beach patrols had received orders to leave their posts,
they would still be there. No single bombing raid,
however terrible, could demoralize those tough, stupid
little beasts. Their meager mental life was shaped
and ruled by discipline. Only their higher officers
were trained to think their way out of a difficulty.</p>

<p class='c014'>The night came swiftly, with no clouds to reflect
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>the sun’s afterglow. This night there would be a
brief interval between sunset and moonrise—just
enough to let the catamaran paddle ashore unseen.
The strong arms of Barry and his teammates made
the most of it. Just as the moon’s silver rim peeped
over the eastern horizon, they grounded their craft
at the jungle’s edge, in the shelter of a little sandspit.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since the tide was high, and already beginning to
ebb, there was no need to tie the catamaran. Pulling
it just out of reach of the waves, the whole party left
it, and followed Barry into the bush.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dora,” the young skipper said, low-voiced, “you
and your people will stay here, within sight of Nanu
and the catamaran. You can stretch your legs, but
don’t move about too much or make a noise. I’ll
leave Mickey Rourke on guard with his tommy-gun.
He’ll watch for Japs and keep an eye on Crayle. The
rest of the boys will go with me to look for a mast.
If we should run into trouble we have our pistols.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’d rather we all went with you, Barry,” the girl
responded. “We could carry Nanu into the bush
where he wouldn’t be found. Where there’s danger,
we shouldn’t be separated.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“If we were all fighting men, I’d agree with you,
Dora,” he said. “As it is, you have no right to risk
the lives of your people in order to stand by me and
my crew. If a Jap patrol spots the catamaran while
we’re gone, your job, and Mickey Rourke’s, is to
fight clear of the beach and push out to sea. Never
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>mind the rest of us. Naturally I hope neither you
nor we are going to be discovered; but if we should
be—well, so long and take care of yourself!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He turned away quickly, beckoning his team after
him, and headed up the beach. By keeping to the
shadows at the jungle’s edge, they remained under
cover and at the same time had light enough to see
where they were going. Each man scanned the jungle
growth nearest him for any slim, straight young
tree that might serve to support the catamaran’s sail.
Bamboo, of course, would be the best, but that could
only be found in the interior.</p>

<p class='c014'>They had gone no more than five hundred yards
when Barry halted, with a sharp hiss of warning.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I heard voices,” he whispered, “ahead of us and
to the left.... There! Did you hear that, Chick?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Jap talk!” muttered the little bombardier.
“Look! Isn’t that the mouth of a creek just beyond
us? I think that’s where they are.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’re right, old Eagle-eye!” the skipper exclaimed.
“Follow me, and don’t make a sound. I
want to see what’s going on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The voices grew louder as they advanced. The
Japs, it appeared, were some little distance up the
creek. From the sounds, Barry judged that they were
loading something into a boat. He found a little
trail bordering the creek bank, and followed it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Where the trail bent sharply to the left, he saw the
flicker of flashlights. Less than a hundred feet away,
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>two Jap motor launches were drawn up to the bank.
Both were partly filled with soldiers. One of them
was still half covered with the camouflage net that
had concealed it during the day. Into the other
launch someone, probably an officer, was being
loaded on a stretcher. The Japs, Barry knew, lost
interest in an ordinary soldier the moment he fell
sick or wounded, and abandoned him promptly.</p>

<p class='c014'>This looked like a general exodus from the island.
If that were the case it could mean only one thing:
The bombing raid had smashed every installation of
value at the air base, including the radio. It must
have killed most of the personnel, too. These thirty
or forty men could be only a small part of the air
field’s ground forces.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the last soldier jumped in, the motors of both
launches sputtered into life. In wondering silence
the American fliers watched their enemies disappear
around the bend, heading out to sea.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you really think that’s the last of ’em?” Hap
Newton asked. “It doesn’t seem possible that we’re
the only ones alive on the island. And yet, why
would <i>two</i> boatloads of Japs clear out if they just
wanted to send for help?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s just one way to make sure what has happened,”
Barry Blake responded. “We’ll follow this
trail to the airfield and see for ourselves. If the Japs
have abandoned the island it won’t be for long, but I
should enjoy a chance to look the place over.”</p>

<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>PATCHED WINGS IN THE DAWN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The trail was easy to follow in the moonlight. It
followed the creek for about a mile, and ended at
the edge of a huge open space. This had been, a few
hours before, the Jap airfield. Now, in the dim light,
the place looked more like the cratered landscape of
the moon than anything on earth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There,” said Soapy Babbitt, pointing to a heap of
coral blocks and rubble, “must be what’s left of the
operations building. Probably the radio was there,
too.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What happened to the planes?” queried Chick
Enders. “There must have been a lot of ’em caught
on the ground, but I can’t see more than two or three
wrecks from here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I guess our bombs pulverized them,” Fred Marmon
said. “Boy! That blitz certainly was thorough.
It’s hard to see how any Japs lived through it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Some of the barrack buildings around the edge
of the field escaped the worst of the bombing, no
doubt,” Barry Blake observed. “We’ll circle the place
now and see if anything is left. Keep your pistols
ready, fellows. If there should be any wounded Japs
left, they’ll open fire on us.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>Blasted, leafless trees that rimmed the field bore
ghastly witness to the size of the bombs. Moonlight
made the scene of destruction more horrible, with
shadows that both concealed and exaggerated. Several
times the searchers stumbled on fragments of
bomb-torn corpses.</p>

<p class='c014'>One end of the field showed fewer bomb craters.
It was here that a number of <i>Mitsubishi</i> bombers
had been lined up when the blitz opened. Either
they had been left there for servicing, or the Japs had
felt so secure that they didn’t bother to scatter their
planes around the field at dispersal points.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first glance most of the bombers seemed to be
intact. If that were the case, a guard might have been
left with them. So as not to walk into a trap, Barry
led his men into the jungle and approached the line-up
from the rear.</p>

<p class='c014'>Two hundred feet back in the bush he came upon
a frame building that sagged drunkenly as if a giant
hand had given it a push. The tin roof had been
blown off, and now lay upside down on a group of
flattened tents. The building had evidently quartered
Jap officers, while the tents served as shelters
for the enlisted personnel. There was no sign of life
in any of them—only half a dozen Japs killed by
shrapnel.</p>

<p class='c014'>The planes, too, were unguarded. On closer inspection
they proved to be hopeless wrecks. Fragmentation
bombs had riddled the bombers with
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>shrapnel holes, torn off wings, ripped the thin-skinned
fuselages. Strangely enough, only two ships
at one end of the line had burned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No wonder the Nip survivors cleared out!” Curly
Levitt remarked. “There aren’t enough usable
parts in the whole line-up to build half a plane, so
far as I can see. Let’s cut a mast for the catamaran,
and get back to the beach, skipper.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry Blake did not move. Deep in thought, he
stood staring at the nearest bomber, which leaned
crazily on one wheel and one wing tip.</p>

<p class='c014'>The plane’s left aileron dangled loosely. Its tail
fin was smashed, and one of the elevators was gone
completely. Great holes showed in the fuselage. The
greenhouse was broken in. Yet something about the
wreck appeared to fascinate the young pilot.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Curly,” he said soberly, “you’ve given me an idea.
We <i>can</i> build a plane with these parts, if the Japs
will give us time. A few shell holes are nothing if
the crate will fly. You fellows beat it back to the
beach and bring the others here. We’ll rig up sleeping
quarters for tonight and begin work at crack of
dawn.... Fred, you stay here with me. We’ll start
looking these planes over now, by moonlight. It will
save time.”</p>

<p class='c014'>If the others had doubts that Barry’s scheme would
work, they failed to mention them. The idea of flying
home appealed so powerfully to their minds that
they would have backed a one-in-twenty chance of
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>success. They headed for the creek trail in high
spirits.</p>

<p class='c014'>When they returned, an hour later, Barry had
good news to tell the whole company. He and Fred
had found two <i>Mitsubishi</i> bombers with engines apparently
unhurt and wings not too badly damaged,
though the tail assemblies, fuselages and undercarriages
were in sad shape. A greater surprise was a
two-place <i>Kawasaki</i> fighter. Its greenhouse and rear
fuselage were full of holes, but its working parts
were undamaged.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hap, you can take off first in that <i>Kawasaki</i> with
the two ladies,” Barry told his co-pilot. “The rest
of us can rebuild one of the bombers and follow you
in a day or two. Finding that fighter plane is a better
break than anything we’ve had yet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Humph!” snorted the bigger man. “It might be—if
you could find somebody else to fly it. But even
then I have a hunch the girls would make trouble.
Claire wouldn’t leave without her father, and Dora
wouldn’t leave without Claire. Of course neither
Chick nor Curly nor I would leave without you, and
nobody else except Crayle knows enough to handle
a plane; and so—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, drive it in the hangar, will you, Hap!” Barry
said with a wry grin. “I know when I’m licked.
We’ll all have to wait till one of the <i>Mitsus</i> is fixed, I
suppose—and just hope that the Japs won’t be back
before we get off. Come on—let’s see what sort of
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>chow and sleeping equipment the Japs have left us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the Jap officers’ wrecked quarters they discovered
a flashlight, and with its help located other
things. There were enough iron cot beds and fairly
clean bedding to supply all the white members of
the party. Best of all, there was plenty of mosquito
netting.</p>

<p class='c014'>The islanders found all they needed in the flattened
tents. A quantity of canned beef and vegetables
was also located, but everyone was too weary
to think of preparing food. As soon as three of the
tents could be set up the whole crowd turned in to
sleep.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next four days and nights were one long, frantic
battle against time, heat, and mechanical difficulties
that only desperate men could have solved. The
men snatched an hour or two of sleep when they
could no longer keep awake. Even Crayle worked at
filling in shell holes to make a runway—not willingly,
but in fear of punishment.</p>

<p class='c014'>The man’s reason was so warped that he regarded
everyone with a sullen hatred. If he could have laid
hands on a gun, anything might have happened. His
companions realized this and took special precautions.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nanu, the wounded native, was made custodian
of the tommy-gun while Mickey Rourke was working.
His instructions were to shoot Crayle rather
than let him come near the weapon. The shell-shocked
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>pilot was sane enough to realize that Nanu
would obey orders to the letter. He made no open
break, but his eyes never lost their cunning look.</p>

<p class='c014'>The repairs to the least-damaged <i>Mitsubishi</i> were
completed by Fred, Soapy, and the two Fortress pilots
within three days. As the work neared completion,
the four men erected a camouflage of wreckage above
their plane, supporting the junk on a framework of
poles. To a Jap pilot flying overhead the restored
<i>Mitsu</i> would be visible only as another hopeless ruin.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last the repair job was finished—even the radio
which they dared not test. The weary mechanics
filled the big bomber’s gas tanks with fuel from other
wrecks. They tested her engines and that of the
<i>Kawasaki</i> fighter.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was planned that Hap Newton should fly alone
in the latter. Reaching Darwin a little ahead of the
<i>Mitsubishi</i>, he would take the risky job of identifying
himself. Once landed, he would prepare the airport’s
defenders for his friends’ arrival in a Jap bombing
plane.</p>

<p class='c014'>One more day was needed to smooth a runway
long enough for the bomber’s take-off. The thirteen
able-bodied members of the party worked feverishly,
with shovels improvised from pieces of wreckage, to
fill in the last gaping bomb craters. The knowledge
that at any time the Japs might return in force was
a spur to their bone-tired bodies. Only Glenn Crayle
stalled, when he thought he was not observed.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>By mid-afternoon one unfilled crater stood between
them and freedom, and the workers, except
Crayle, were all at the point of exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll lay off for an hour, friends,” Barry Blake
croaked, as he wiped a dirty hand across his forehead.
“Can’t afford to break down with success almost in
sight. A cool drink and a rest will help us to finish
the job by night....”</p>

<p class='c014'>He broke off as a distant hum of engines grew on
the air.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Planes coming!” he yelled. “Take cover!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Dropping their tools, the little crowd staggered
into the sheltering bush. As they flung themselves
down, a squadron of <i>Mitsubishis</i> sailed into view.
At twenty-thousand feet, they looked like small silver
flying fish.</p>

<p class='c014'>Probably, Barry thought, they were scanning the
island for signs of enemy activity. He wondered if
they would notice the smooth strip at the edge of
the bomb-pocked field.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was not left long in doubt. Three of the bombers
peeled off and circled down in wide, slow spirals.
They were wary, those Jap pilots, of another Guadalcanal-style
occupation. The newly smoothed runway
strip must have looked to them exceedingly suspicious.</p>

<p class='c014'>A shout from Nanu at the other end of the runway
rang above the droning of enemy engines. There
was alarm in it, and pain. A cry from Dora Wilcox
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>echoed it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry sprang to his feet and raced through the
bush, in the direction of the planes. Behind him he
could hear his crew panting.</p>

<p class='c014'>Their progress was maddeningly slow, yet they
dared not leave the bush. Once the enemy planes
guessed their identity bullets would fly, and bombs
would fall.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Crayle’s grabbed the tommy-gun, I’ll bet,” Chick
Enders gasped as he fought to keep up with Barry.
“The idiot <i>would</i> pick a time like this. Oh-oh!
There he is—in the—uh—<i>Kawasaki</i>!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The bomber’s team halted as Crayle saw them and
swung his sub-machine gun to cover them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stay back!” he warned hysterically. “You can’t
keep me here on the ground while they’re dropping
bombs on us. I’ll kill you if you come another
step.... You, Nanu—walk that propeller around
once again, or I’ll kill you, too. <i>Turn it, you fool!</i>”</p>

<p class='c014'>Nanu, sweating with the pain of his injured leg,
grasped the <i>Kawasaki’s</i> propeller and leaned his
weight on it. Off balance, he slipped to his knees.
The fall probably saved his life, for at that moment
the engine coughed into life.</p>

<p class='c014'>Crayle did not wait for the engine to warm up....
Scarcely had Nanu dragged himself out of the way of
the wheels when they rolled forward. The <i>Kawasaki</i>
rushed down the runway trailing a cloud of dust.
Her tail came up. Then, just as she reached the end
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>of the strip something went wrong.</p>

<p class='c014'>Either the plane had not gathered sufficient speed,
or Crayle failed to ease back on the stick soon
enough. Instead of rising, the wheels struck the far
edge of the unfilled bomb crater. The <i>Kawasaki</i>
went end over end, with a rending crash.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fire burst from the center section. The whole
plane exploded in a giant bloom of flame. Above it
the Jap bombers zoomed, and spiralled upward to
join their formation. The Kawasaki’s futile attempt
to take off had at least convinced them that the field
was not in enemy hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry turned around to find Dora and Claire Barrows
bandaging Nanu’s re-opened wound. They appeared
far more concerned over the suffering native
boy than about Glenn Crayle’s flaming death.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How soon do you think we can get Nanu to a
hospital, Barry?” the girl missionary queried anxiously.
“This new loss of blood is likely to bring on
a fever, and we haven’t a thing to treat it with.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young skipper looked toward the <i>Kawasaki’s</i>
wreckage, blazing on the other side of the last bomb
crater.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll have that hole filled before midnight,
Dora,” he said wearily. “It will have to be Glenn
Crayle’s grave. When the earth is smoothed down
and the burned plane is hauled aside, there should
be enough runway for the bomber. We’ll take off at
dawn, and be over Port Darwin in two hours—if we’re
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>not intercepted.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At breakfast time the next morning an excited
radio officer telephoned the O.C. at Port Darwin
airfield.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Message just received for you, sir,” he reported.
“It purports to be sent by Lieutenant Barry Blake of
the United States Army Air Forces, who’s been missing
since the raid on Amboina. He says he is flying a
<i>Mitsubishi</i> bomber with his B-26 crew and seven
refugees aboard and asks permission to come in.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Barry Blake!” exclaimed the Australian colonel.
“I should know that name. There’s a Yankee captain
having breakfast with me, who’s been talking of little
else. He came here with a fantastic notion that Blake
would pop up sooner or later. We’ll jog down to the
radio room and let Captain Tex O’Grady identify
your mysterious pilot.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Not a trace of fog obscured the Australian coast as
Barry Blake picked out the rugged mass of Melville
Island. The <i>Mitsu’s</i> patched wings glinted like silver
in the early sunlight. Landing should be easy, but
before giving permission, the O.C. had insisted on
identifying the bomber’s crew by their voices. The
Jap radio was tuned on the port’s wave length.</p>

<p class='c014'>Without warning Tex O’Grady’s voice rang in the
crew’s earphones.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dawg-gone you, Barry,” it said. “Where did you
Fortress men get the idea that you could desert <i>Sweet
Rosy O’Grady</i> and go gallivanting off with a silly little
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>B-26? No wonder you-all had to come home in
a Jap crate! What happened, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Skipper!</i>” Barry shouted joyfully. “Where are
you—at Port Darwin? What brought you here—”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s the Old Man himself!” gasped Curly Levitt.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Captain!” yelped Fred Marmon. “How are you,
sir? And what’s the good news?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Reef back, boys!” Tex O’Grady’s humorous
drawl answered them. “I’m not answering questions
until you come in and we have a chance to talk. But
the news is this: Your part in finding and helping to
smash the big Jap flotilla off New Guinea has won
Barry a captain’s bars and the rest some decorations.
And here’s the best little item of all, I reckon....”</p>

<p class='c014'>He paused briefly, as if trying to control a new
huskiness in his speech.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You boys,” he continued, “have drawn a thirty-day
furlough, and we’re all going—going home to the
States in <i>Sweet Rosy O’Grady</i>, as soon as she’s
patched up enough to make the trip. Here’s Colonel
Raymond with a word you’ve been waiting for.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Barry’s head felt queerly light, and the mention
of “home” had brought a lump to his throat that
would not go down. As if from a great distance he
heard a strange voice speaking.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Permission to land is herewith granted,” the Australian
O.C. said. “And may all your future landings
be as happy as this one, <i>Captain</i> Barry Blake of the
Flying Fortress!”</p>
